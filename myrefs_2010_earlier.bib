	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: We describe our adaptation of the team strategies and tools to enhance performance and patient safety (TeamSTEPPS) for use as an educational intervention for medical and nursing students. We hypothesized that participation in a team training program using the modified TeamSTEPPS program would positively affect knowledge and attitudes toward teamwork skills and their ability to recognize the presence and quality of team skills. METHODS: Two hundred thirteen students participated in a 4-hour team training program that included a lecture followed by small group team training exercises. Nurse/physician pairs facilitated student team activities. Knowledge and attitudes were assessed before and after the educational intervention. Recognition of team skills was assessed using videos. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found with participant knowledge (P{\textless}0.001) and attitude (P=0.004). Students were able to identify the presence and quality of team skills in the video vignettes. Overwhelmingly, the students recognized team skills much better in the success video than in the opportunity video (P{\textless}0.001), and they rated the success video much higher than the opportunity video (P{\textless}0.001) with regards to the quality of team skills. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully adapted TeamSTEPPS for use with our medical and nursing students, educated facilitators, and implemented the course. Our students improved their knowledge of vital team and communication skills, attitudes toward working as teams, and were able to identify effective team skills.},

The purpose of this study was to examine differences between overweight adults with and without WC risk in four domains: demographic, clinical and biological, psychological, and behavioral. The sample (N = 87) was primarily sedentary, middle-aged, women, and African-Americans. The majority of participants had WC risk, those with WC risk were older, were women, and had higher body mass index, higher morning salivary cortisol levels, and more depressive symptoms than those without WC risk. Caloric and macronutrient intake did not differ between those with and without WC risk. Our findings could lead to the development of targeted interventions to prevent and/or reduce abdominal obesity, thereby reducing cardiometabolic risk.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE: Abdominal obesity, the central distribution of adipose tissue, is a well-established cardiometabolic disease risk factor. The prevalence has steadily increased since 1988, and now more than 50\% of adults have abdominal obesity. Psychological distress coupled with increased dietary energy density (ED) may contribute to abdominal obesity. Guided by the stress and coping model, this study examined the relationship between psychological factors (perceived stress and depressive symptoms) and dietary ED in overweight, working adults. The first hypothesis tested if psychological factors explained a significant amount of food and beverage ED variance above that accounted for by demographic factors. The second hypothesis tested if psychological factors explained a significant amount of food and nonalcoholic beverage ED variance above that accounted for by demographic factors. Post hoc analyses compared macronutrient composition and food group pattern between overweight, working adults with and without depressive symptoms. METHODS: This descriptive, cross-sectional, correlation study was composed of 87 overweight, working adults (mean age, 41.3 [SD, 10.2] years; mean body mass index, 32.1 [SD, 6.1] kg/m²; 73.6\% women; 50.6\% African American). Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory II and Perceived Stress Scale and weighed-3-day-food record analyzed for caloric intake (kilocalories) and weight (in grams) of consumed foods and beverages that were used to calculate ED (in kilocalories/gram). Height and weight were measured to calculate body mass index. Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, and sequential regression modeling were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms were reported by 21.9\% of participants and explained variance in food and beverage ED above that accounted for by African American race and reporting adequate caloric intake. Depressive symptoms explained variance in food and nonalcoholic beverage ED above that accounted for male sex, African American race, and reporting adequate caloric intake. Perceived stress and depressive symptoms were positively correlated; however, perceived stress was not a significant predictor of food and beverage ED. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms, potentially modifiable, were 4 times that found in the general population and independently predicted increased food and beverage ED. Further research is needed to determine if improvements in depressive symptoms alter dietary ED, potentially reducing cardiometabolic disease risk.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a combined 12-week home-based exercise (EX)/cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program (n=18) with CBT alone (n=19), EX alone (n=20), and with usual care (UC, n=17) in stable New York Heart Association Class II to III heart failure (HF) patients diagnosed with depression. METHODS: Depressive symptom severity [Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D)], physical function [6-min walk test (6MWT)], and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire) were evaluated at baseline (T1), after the 12-week intervention/control (T2), and following a 3-month telephone follow-up (T3). A repeated measures analysis of variance was used to determine group differences. Depression severity was dichotomized as minor (HAM-D, 11-14) and moderate-to-major depression (HAM-D, {\textgreater}/=15), and group intervention and control responses were also evaluated on that basis. RESULTS: The greatest reduction in HAM-D scores over time occurred in the EX/CBT group (-10.4) followed by CBT (-9.6), EX (-7.3), and UC (-6.2), but none were statistically significant. The combined group showed a significant increase in 6-min walk distance at 24 weeks (F=13.5, P{\textless}.001). Among all groups with moderate-to-major depression, only those in CBT/EX had sustained lower HAM-D scores at 12 and 24 weeks, 6MWT distances were significantly greater at 12 (P=.018) and 24 (P=.013) weeks, and the greatest improvement in HRQOL also occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions designed to improve both physical and psychological symptoms may provide the best method for optimizing functioning and enhancing HRQOL in patients with HF.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: : Caregivers (CGs) of heart failure (HF) patients are increasingly assuming greater responsibilities in symptom assessment, evaluation, and decision making and may be asked to serve as proxies. The purpose of this study was to examine the degree of congruence between HF patients and their primary CG on symptom assessment and self-care management behaviors. METHODS: : The sample consisted of 70 HF patients receiving home healthcare and their designated CG. Patients were primarily between 40 and 85 years of age and female (60\%). Caregivers were predominately female (76\%) and spouses (43\%). Congruence in symptom assessment and management between HF patients and their designated CGs was measured in this descriptive cross-sectional study using the Heart Failure Symptom Survey and Self-care of Heart Failure Index. RESULTS: : The Spearman correlation coefficient and concordance correlation coefficient were used to assess the degree of congruence on symptom evaluation scores from the Heart Failure Symptom Survey. Dyads had the strongest correlations on ratings of the HF patients' symptoms of extremity edema, difficulty concentrating, and dizziness. Lower congruence (Spearman correlation {\textless}0.40) was found on feeling depressed, shortness of breath at night, and shortness of breath when lying down. Scores on the Self-care of Heart Failure Index self-care management and self-care confidence scales were not significantly different within the HF dyads. CONCLUSIONS: : Based on moderate levels of correlations on most HF symptoms in this study, the CG as proxy appears to be a reasonable substitute for patient responses in a community setting. However, greater family preparation for symptom assessment is warranted to improve congruence for future symptom assessment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the clinical attributes of severe asthma in children have been well described, the differentiating features of the lower airway inflammatory response are less understood. OBJECTIVES: We sought to discriminate severe from moderate asthma in children by applying linear discriminant analysis, a supervised method of high-dimensional data reduction, to cytokines and chemokines measured in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and alveolar macrophage (AM) lysate. METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was available from 53 children with asthma (severe asthma, n = 31) undergoing bronchoscopy for clinical indications and 30 nonsmoking adults. Twenty-three cytokines and chemokines were measured by using bead-based multiplex assays. Linear discriminant analyses of the BAL fluid and AM analytes were performed to develop predictive models of severe asthma in children. RESULTS: Although univariate analysis of single analytes did not differentiate severe from moderate asthma in children, linear discriminant analyses allowed for near complete separation of the moderate and severe asthmatic groups. Significant correlations were also noted between several of the AM and BAL analytes measured. In the BAL fluid, IL-13 and IL-6 differentiated subjects with asthma from controls, whereas growth-related oncogene (CXCL1), RANTES (CCL5), IL-12, IFN-gamma, and IL-10 best characterized severe versus moderate asthma in children. In the AM lysate, IL-6 was the strongest discriminator of all the groups. CONCLUSION: Severe asthma in children is characterized by a distinct airway molecular phenotype that does not have a clear T(H)1 or T(H)2 pattern. Improved classification of children with severe asthma may assist with the development of targeted therapeutics for this group of children who are difficult to treat.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVE: Several heart failure (HF) knowledge tools have been developed and tested over the past decade; however, they vary in content, format, psychometric properties, and availability. This article details the development, psychometric testing, and revision of the Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test (A-HFKT) as a standardized instrument for both the research and clinical settings. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Development and psychometric testing of the A-HFKT were undertaken with 116 New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II and III community-dwelling HF patients and their family members (FMs) participating in a family intervention study. Internal consistency, reliability, and content validity were examined. Construct validity was assessed by correlating education level, literacy, dietary sodium ingestion, medication adherence, and healthcare utilization with knowledge. RESULTS: Content validity ratings on relevance and clarity ranged from 0.55 to 1.0, with 81\% of the items rated from 0.88 to 1.0. Cronbach alpha values were .84 for patients, .75 for FMs, and .73 for combined results. Construct validity testing revealed a small but significant correlation between higher patient and FM knowledge on sodium restriction questions and lower ingested sodium, r = -0.17, P = .05 and r = -0.19, P = .04, respectively, and between patient knowledge and number of days that medications were taken correctly (diuretics: r = 0.173, P {\textless} .05, and angiotensin-converting enzyme: r = 0.223, P = .01). Finally, patients seeking emergency care or requiring hospitalization in the 4 months before study entry were found to have significantly lower FM knowledge using both t test and logistic regression modeling. CONCLUSIONS: The A-HFKT was revised using the content and construct validity data and is available for use with HF patients and FMs. The construct validity testing indicates that patient knowledge has a significant relationship to aspects of self-care. Furthermore, family knowledge may influence patient adherence with sodium restriction and healthcare utilization behavior.},

A solution for detecting illegal Cannabis cultivation using remote sensing would be of considerable assistance and may increase the probability of detection. If multiple plants are grown in large homogeneous plots and the location of at least one cultivation site is known, then detection can be considered a traditional spectral land cover/land use classification problem. Probability of success is principally dependent upon the degree to which the known grow site is representative of unknown sites, and the adequacy of the sensor system spatial resolution. However, most illegal cultivation sites in the U.S. are "distributed" with a few isolated plants interspersed with other plant species. For distributed cultivations, requirements for high spatial resolution imagery become paramount and an alternative signature approach may be warranted. Analysis of Cannabis diffuse, nadir spectral signatures using laboratory, field and airborne data show a lack of stable, unique absorption features to use as a universal reference signature. However, Cannabis leaves appear to have a specular reflectance feature that contributes to the "emerald green" appearance reported by aerial spotters. This specular signature may be worthy of exploitation for detection. The leaf shape and plant architecture of Cannabis also offer potential spatial signatures that can be quantified using image texture analysis. These spatial signatures also warrant further investigation.},

	abstract = {Although the potential benefits of infrared imaging systems in law enforcement applications have been apparent for many years, budget and technology constraints have prevented their widespread deployment. Recent technology improvements and cost reductions, however, have made the routine use of handheld thermal imagers practical for the law enforcement community. This effort involved both an analysis of operational and technical requirements associated with law enforcement use as well as a comprehensive review of commercially available handheld infrared imaging systems. The use of handheld infrared systems in the counterdrug environment is also addressed, including the results of an analysis of proven applications, a review of training requirements, and a summary of legal issues associated with infrared surveillance. Results generated by the NVTHERM infrared sensor model are also shown for one handheld imager to provide representative information regarding low-cost thermal imager performance.},

The use of sodium borodeuteride for reduction in the derivatization scheme enables identification of aldohexoses because their hexitol hexaacetate products retain the chirality of the starting sugar. The observed differences in the EI-mass spectra were visualized using principal component analysis and cluster analysis. The statistical significance of these differences was evaluated using Hotelling's T2 statistic for the comparison of multivariate cluster means. The electron impact mass spectra of nondeuterated and deuterated hexitol hexaacetates permit differentiation of the diastereomeric nondeuterated hexitol hexaacetates as well as identification of all of the aldohexoses. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

Major Raman bands were assigned by comparison to spectra for small model molecules, by use of ab initio calculations, and by reference to previous literature. The set of FT-Raman spectra taken at various intervals during the curing process was modeled by principal component analysis (PCA). Cure percentage determined by differential scanning calorimetry was then regressed against scores on the first principal component for the different polymer samples. The PCA and regression results summarized significant trends in the FT-Raman spectra and led to a better understanding of the curing mechanism. © 1994.},
