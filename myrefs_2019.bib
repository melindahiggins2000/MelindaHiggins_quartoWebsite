	abstract = {Hypertension, a modifiable risk factor of cardiovascular disease, is largely responsible for the disproportionate morbidity and mortality in black women. Black women 20 years of age and older have a higher prevalence of HTN compared to white women (44\% vs 28\%). Poor adherence and non-adherence to hypertensive medications have been strongly indicated as a primary contributor to the early onset of disparity in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality experienced by black people. The purpose of this study was to examine medication adherence in black women relative to sociodemographic, clinical, cultural context, psychosocial, cognitive, and behavioral factors. This was a prospective, descriptive cross-sectional study of N = 85, hypertensive black women, with mean age of 39 ± 5.4 years, 18-45 years of age. Variables and measures included: sociodemographic characteristics, clinical, adverse social stressors, psychosocial, cognitive-behavioral factors, and medication adherence. Descriptive statistics, correlations, multivariate logistic regressions, and moderation analysis were tested. 81.2\% (n = 69) of the sample was categorized as non-adherent. SBP was the only clinical covariate associated with HTN medication adherence. HTN illness perceptions, composite score, resilient coping, depressive symptoms, exposure to lifetime gender, and racial stressors, were not associated with HTN medication adherence. Using multivariate logistic regression, decreased SBP and lower scores on the "Consequence" dimension of the HTN illness perception scale were associated with medication adherence (χ2 = 10.53, P = .001). Adherence was associated with both the "Consequence" and "Identity" dimensions of the HTN illness perception scale indicating the need and importance for clinicians to have open and honest communication regarding HTN and its treatment in facilitating adherence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Constipation after orthopaedic surgery occurs frequently, likely due to a combination of high levels of opioid medications for severe pain management and mobility limitations after surgery. It can result in serious complications, increased cost, and patient discomfort. PURPOSE: This study evaluated a natural food-based fiber solution to prevent constipation in postoperative orthopaedic patients. METHODS: A posttest control group-randomized study design was used. Dependent variables were presence of postoperative constipation, time to first bowel movement (BM), and total number of postoperative BMs. Descriptive statistics, Student's t tests, and Mann-Whitney nonparametric 2-group tests with chi-square analysis were used. Level of significance for all tests was p {\textless} .05. Forty-six participants were evaluated. RESULTS: Ages were similar for both the intervention and control groups. Bowel Function Index (BFI) scores were not significantly different (p = .448). No significant group differences were present for the individual BFI item scores (p {\textgreater} .05). The number of patients with a BM during the first 3 days was not significantly different (p = .489). There were no significant differences found between the 2 groups regarding laxative administration (p {\textgreater} .05 for all laxatives). CONCLUSION: Further studies are indicated that address natural fibers and pharmaceutical methods for the prevention of constipation after spinal surgery.},

	abstract = {The ability of patients to adhere to medication regimens is considered critical to achieving optimal results. Many patients are discharged with aspirin (ASA) as an anticoagulant for venous thrombosis embolism prophylaxis after joint replacement surgery. In studies where ASA was prescribed as an antithrombotic after selected orthopaedic surgeries, both lack of understanding and missing doses were identified as factors that affected adherence rates (D. , ). The purpose of this study was to explore the preliminary impact of a preset telephone alarm on medication adherence in adults prescribed ASA for 35 days after knee or hip arthroplasty. This was a randomized controlled trial (n = 79). Adherence was measured with a four-question self-reporting tool. Average age was 61 years. The majority were female (59.5\%) and Caucasian (62.0\%) with college or graduate degree-level education (78.5\%). When comparing the groups, there were no significant differences between the two groups for the demographics of age, gender, and race. The alarm group had significantly better adherence rates, with fewer people who forgot to take their ASA; only 29.7\% of the alarm group ever forgot to take their medication compared with 59.5\% of the no-alarm group (p = .008). It seems that simple cell phone alarms can serve as effective reminders to patients to take selected medications as prescribed.},

	abstract = {We report the reliability, validity, and feasibility of self-performed picture pill count (PPC) as an adherence measure that was used in a randomized trial with HIV positive people living in rural Georgia. The first 61 (of 149) participants conducted an additional PPC 1-2 days after baseline. Reliability, measured by a PPC scoring instrument, analyzed participants' ability to reproduce high quality pill count photographs free from artifact or blurring that could hamper accurate visualization of the pills and bottle labels. Except for label blur, baseline photographs (performed with coaching by study staff) and independently performed post-baseline photographs were rated as acceptable quality ({\textgreater} 93\%). Label blur significantly worsened between the baseline and post-baseline scoring (93\% vs 80\%, p = 0.039), possibly indicating that participants required more education to ensure readability. Validity was determined by comparing the number of pills entered into the PC survey with the number of pills in the texted PPC; 77.5\% of participants had perfectly matched pill counts (r = 0.690, p {\textless} 0.001). We found PCC to be a reliable and valid method of measuring adherence. The high rate of participant satisfaction underscores its feasibility. It provides an innovative alternative to other more invasive and labor intensive methods of measuring adherence using pill counts.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial correlates of diabetes self-care behaviors in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and comorbid heart failure (HF). METHOD: Baseline data of 180 participants from a clinical trial that tested a 6-month integrated self-care intervention for persons with comorbid HF and T2D were analyzed. Correlational bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to examine correlates of diabetes self-care behaviors. RESULT: Participants had a mean age of 58 ± 11years; the majority were male (n = 118, 66\%) and African American (n = 119, 66\%). Number of comorbidities {\textgreater}2 (P {\textless} .001), having more than a high school education (P {\textless} .05), and African American ethnicity (P {\textless} .05) predicted better exercise, self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG), and foot care behaviors, respectively. The use of an aldosterone inhibitor (P {\textless} .05) predicted worse exercise performance, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (P {\textless} .01) predicted worse SMBG, and treatment with diet plus medication (P {\textless} .05) and dyslipidemia (P {\textless} .001) predicted worse foot care. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study provide new insights into the complex self-care requirements for T2D patients with comorbid HF. Integrated self-care interventions are clearly warranted in persons living with multiple chronic conditions for optimal health outcomes and the prevention of complications. Our sample of predominately African American men showed they had better T2D self-care behaviors than whites than previously reported. Additional research is needed to determine racial and gender differences on health outcomes in persons with T2D and comorbid HF.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: African Americans are disproportionately affected by hypertension and have lower medication adherence when compared to other racial groups. Antecedent factors such as beliefs surrounding hypertension, the presence or absence of social support, and depressive symptoms have not been extensively studied collectively in relation to hypertension medication adherence in African Americans. OBJECTIVE: To determine the associations among demographic and clinical factors, depressive symptoms, hypertension beliefs, and social support with blood pressure medication adherence in middle-aged African American adults with a diagnosis of hypertension. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of (N = 120) African Americans (mean age, 49 years; 22.5\% men) with a current diagnosis of metabolic syndrome, including hypertension, who reported having and taking a prescribed blood pressure-lowering medication were included. Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlation analysis, and logistic regression using odds ratio were used to examine the effects of high blood pressure beliefs, social support, and depression on medication adherence. RESULTS: A small but significant relationship was found between medication adherence and number of comorbidities (r = 0.19, P = .04). In a multivariate regression model, after controlling for gender, comorbidities remained associated with medication adherence (β = 0. 77, P = .04). Depressive symptoms, high blood pressure beliefs, and social support did not have a significant relationship with medication adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple comorbidities may have a positive impact upon medication adherence. Further study is needed in a larger sample of African Americans who have a diagnosis of hypertension in addition to other comorbidities requiring medication management.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that cost sharing adversely affects appropriate prescription drug use for chronic disorders. However, few studies have evaluated this effect in heart failure (HF), the most common cause of hospitalization in Medicare. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether spending on HF pharmacotherapy by Medicare Part D enrollees was associated with prescription refill adherence. METHODS: This correlational study used pooled data from the 2010-2012 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). The analysis sample consisted of community-dwelling MCBS participants with self-reported HF and continuous Part D coverage during the year of participation. 3 drug classes were analyzed independently: beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). 1,448 weighted participant-year records (derived from 964 individuals) met the inclusion criteria, of which 846 (58\%) were included for beta-blockers, 633 (44\%) for ACE inhibitors, and 229 (16\%) for ARBs. Spending was measured by average out-of-pocket payment for the relevant prescription, standardized to a 30-day supply, as a percentage of average monthly income. Adherence was measured by the medication possession ratio (MPR): total days supplied for all but the last refill divided by number of days between the first and last fills of the year. RESULTS: Accounting for sampling weights, the median (interquartile range) monthly income was {\textbackslash}1,472 ({\textbackslash}949-\$2,466), and average percentage of monthly income spent on a 30-day medication supply was 0.22\% for beta-blockers, 0.19\% for ACE inhibitors, and 0.90\% for ARBs. Mean MPR was 88.9\% for beta-blockers, 88.5\% for ACE inhibitors, and 90.4\% for ARBs. Risk-adjusted models showed that percentage of income spent on a beta-blocker prescription was directly associated with odds of nonadherence (MPR {\textless} 80\%), odds ratio = 1.38, 95\% CI = 1.01-1.89, P = 0.045, and inversely associated with beta-blocker MPR, B = -4.17, SE = 1.23, P = 0.001. No such association was observed for ACE inhibitors or ARBs. CONCLUSIONS: Price sensitivity was evident for beta-blockers but not for antiangiotensin drugs, despite very low out-of-pocket costs and high adherence. This study is relevant to value-based pricing of HF management drugs in Part D plans. DISCLOSURES: No outside funding supported this study.

	abstract = {Nurse scientists are adept at translating findings from basic science into useful clinical- and community-based interventions to improve health. Over time, the focus of some nursing research has grown to include the assessment and evaluation of genomic and other output from high-throughput, or "omic," technologies as indicators related to health and disease. To date, the growth in the application of omics technologies in nursing research has included calls to increase attention to omics in nursing school curricula and educational training opportunities, such as the Summer Genetics Institute offered by the National Institute of Nursing Research. However, there has been scant attention paid in the nursing literature to the complexity of data analysis or issues of reproducibility related to omics studies. The goals of this article are to (1) familiarize nurse scientists with tools that encourage reproducibility in omics studies, with a focus on the free and open-source data processing and analysis pipeline, and (2) provide a baseline understanding of how these tools can be used to improve collaboration and cohesion among interdisciplinary research team members. Knowledge of these tools and skill in applying them will be important for communication across disciplines and imperative for the advancement of omics research in nursing.},
