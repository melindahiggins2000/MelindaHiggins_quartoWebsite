	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although family influences in heart failure (HF) care are considered important, little evidence is available regarding relationships between the family context and specific outcomes for patients with HF. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the relationships of patient perceptions of family functioning, autonomy support, and perceived criticism, as well as their family member's (FM) HF knowledge, with patient outcomes of depressive symptoms and HF quality of life (QOL). METHODS: Participants (n = 117) with HF were enrolled in a family partnership intervention study. Self-report questionnaires measuring the HF patient's perceptions of family context and the FM's knowledge were analyzed relative to the HF patient's outcomes using correlations and sequential multivariate regression analyses. Only preintervention, baseline data are reported here. RESULTS: Age, ethnicity, Charlson comorbidity index, global family functioning, and FM's HF knowledge accounted for 37.8\% (P {\textless} .001) of the variance in the patient's depressive symptoms. An additional moderating effect of ethnicity on the association between global family functioning and patient's depressive symptoms was significant (change R2 = 0.06, P = .001), resulting in a final model that accounted for 43.3\% of depressive symptom variance. Age, ethnicity, global family functioning, and autonomy support accounted for 24.9\% (P {\textless} .001) of the variance in emotional HF QOL. An additional moderating effect of ethnicity on the association between global family functioning and patient's emotional HF QOL was significant (change R2 = 0.05, P = .009), resulting in a final model that accounted for 28.9\% of emotional QOL variance. CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the importance of the patient's perspective on family functioning and autonomy support, along with FM's HF knowledge, on HF patient outcomes moderated by ethnicity. Future interventions could target the modifiable patient-family context relationships for improving depressive symptoms and QOL in HF patients. These findings point to the need for greater family assessment to identify those at risk for worse outcomes and to guide family focused interventions.},

	doi = {10.1186/1478-4491-12-47},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given the global nursing shortage and investments to scale-up the workforce, this study evaluated trends in annual student nurse enrolment, pre-service attrition between enrolment and registration, and factors that influence nurse production in Kenya. METHODS: This study used a mixed methods approach with data from the Regulatory Human Resources Information System (tracks initial student enrolment through registration) and the Kenya Health Workforce Information System (tracks deployment and demographic information on licensed nurses) for the quantitative analyses and qualitative data from key informant interviews with nurse training institution educators and/or administrators. Trends in annual student nurse enrolment from 1999 to 2010 were analyzed using regulatory and demographic data. To assess pre-service attrition between training enrolment and registration with the nursing council, data for a cohort that enrolled in training from 1999 to 2004 and completed training by 2010 was analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to test for factors that significantly affected attrition. To assess the capacity of nurse training institutions for scale-up, qualitative data was obtained through key informant interviews. RESULTS: From 1999 to 2010, 23,350 students enrolled in nurse training in Kenya. While annual new student enrolment doubled between 1999 (1,493) and 2010 (3,030), training institutions reported challenges in their capacity to accommodate the increased numbers. Key factors identified by the nursing faculty included congestion at clinical placement sites, limited clinical mentorship by qualified nurses, challenges with faculty recruitment and retention, and inadequate student housing, transportation and classroom space. Pre-service attrition among the cohort that enrolled between 1999 and 2004 and completed training by 2010 was found to be low (6\%). CONCLUSION: To scale-up the nursing workforce in Kenya, concurrent investments in expanding the number of student nurse clinical placement sites, utilizing alternate forms of skills training, hiring more faculty and clinical instructors, and expanding the dormitory and classroom space to accommodate new students are needed to ensure that increases in student enrolment are not at the cost of quality nursing education. Student attrition does not appear to be a concern in Kenya compared to other African countries (10 to 40\%).},

	abstract = {Studies show 30\% to 47\% of people with heart failure (HF) have concomitant diabetes mellitus (DM). Self-care for persons with both of these chronic conditions is conflicting, complex, and often inadequate. This pilot study tested an integrated self-care program for its effects on HF and DM knowledge, self-care efficacy, self-care behaviors, and quality of life (QOL). Hospitalized HF-DM participants (N = 71) were randomized to usual care or intervention using a 1:2 allocation and followed at 30 and 90 days after intervention. Intervention was an integrated education and counseling program focused on HF-DM self-care. Variables included demographic and clinical data, knowledge about HF and DM, HF- and DM-specific self-efficacy, standard HF and DM QOL scales, and HF and DM self-care behaviors. Analysis included descriptive statistics, multilevel longitudinal models for group and time effects, post hoc testing, and effect size calculations. Sidak adjustments were used to control for type 1 error inflation. The integrated HF-DM self-care intervention conferred effects on improved HF knowledge (30 days, p = .05), HF self-care maintenance (30 and 90 days, p {\textless} .001), HF self-care management (90 days, p = .05), DM self-efficacy (30 days, p = .03; 90 days, p = .004), general diet (30 days, p = .05), HF physical QOL (p = .04), and emotional QOL scores (p = .05) at 90 days within the intervention group. The participants in the usual care group also reported increased total and physical QOL. Greater percentages of participants in the intervention group improved self reported exercise between 0 and 30 days (p = .005 and moderate effect size ES = .47) and foot care between 0 and 90 days (p = .03, small ES = .36). No group differences or improvements in DM-specific QOL were observed. An integrated HF-DM self-care intervention was effective in improving essential components of self-care and had sustained (90 day) effects on selected self-care behaviors. Future studies testing HF-DM integrated self-care interventions in larger samples with longer follow-up and on other outcomes such as hospitalization and clinical markers are warranted.},

	abstract = {Nurse investigators often collect study data in the form of counts. Traditional methods of data analysis have historically approached analysis of count data either as if the count data were continuous and normally distributed or with dichotomization of the counts into the categories of occurred or did not occur. These outdated methods for analyzing count data have been replaced with more appropriate statistical methods that make use of the Poisson probability distribution, which is useful for analyzing count data. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the Poisson distribution and its use in Poisson regression. Assumption violations for the standard Poisson regression model are addressed with alternative approaches, including addition of an overdispersion parameter or negative binomial regression. An illustrative example is presented with an application from the ENSPIRE study, and regression modeling of comorbidity data is included for illustrative purposes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the mesenteric tissue oxygenation response in preterm infants fed and not fed during red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, observational comparison of mesenteric oxygenation using near-infrared spectroscopy in preterm infants ({\textless}33 weeks' at birth) who were fed or not fed during RBC transfusion. Tissue oxygenation means were examined up to 48 hours after each transfusion event. RESULTS: Mean mesenteric regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) slopes during RBC transfusion of fed (n = 9) vs not fed (n = 8) infants ranged from -0.23 to +0.23 (mean 0.04) with no differences between groups (P = .480). However, following transfusions, postprandial mesenteric oxygenation means significantly declined in infants fed during transfusion compared with infants not fed during transfusion (P {\textless} .001). Infants fed during RBC transfusion had a mean 2.16 point decrease in rSO2 mesenteric oxygenation with each sequential feeding post-transfusion, whereas infants not fed during RBC transfusion increased their rSO2 postprandial mesenteric oxygenation by a mean of 2.09 points. CONCLUSIONS: Mesenteric tissue oxygenation during RBC transfusion is not influenced by feeding status. However, infants fed during RBC transfusion had, for the next 15 hours, decreasing postprandial mesenteric tissue oxygenation patterns compared with infants not fed during RBC transfusion. Feeding during RBC transfusions may increase the risk for mesenteric ischemia and the development of transfusion-related necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants.},
