	abstract = {Early life adversity/stress (ELA/ELS), particularly adverse caregiving experiences such as child maltreatment (MALT), is a main risk factor for psychopathology, including psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, ADHD, and substance abuse. Yet how these alterations unfold during development and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, as it is difficult to prospectively and longitudinally study early developmental phases in humans, and nearly impossible to disentangle postnatal caregiving effects from heritable traits. This study examined the specific effects of "nurture" (maternal care) versus "nature" (heritable, biological maternal factors) on nonhuman primate infant socioemotional, stress neuroendocrine, and physical development. For this we used a translational and naturalistic macaque model of infant maltreatment by the mother with randomized assignment at birth to either mothers with a history of maltreating their infants (MALT group, n = 22) or to competent mothers (Control group, n = 20). Over the first 6 months of life (roughly equivalent to 2 years in humans), we examined the development of the mother-infant relationship, as well as infants' social behavior and emotional reactivity. In parallel, we assessed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function longitudinally, using measures of hair cortisol accumulation, and basal morning plasma cortisol. We identified broad impairments in maternal care exhibited by MALT foster mothers, beyond maltreatment (physical abuse, rejection) events, suggesting that MALT foster mothers provide an overall lower quality of care to their infants compared to Controls. MALT infants exhibited alterations in their initiations and breaks of proximity towards their mothers, as well as heightened emotional reactivity in comparison to Controls. Most striking are the HPA axis findings, with MALT infants showing higher levels of plasma cortisol across the first 6 postnatal months as well as higher hair cortisol accumulation from birth through month 6 (a signature of chronic stress) than Controls. No caregiving effects were detected on physical growth, which ruled out confounding effects of maternal nutrition, metabolism, etc. Taken together, these results suggest that the developmental trajectory of MALT and Control infants is different, marked by heightened levels of emotional reactivity, increased HPA activity and alterations in mother-infant interactions in MALT animals. These findings appear to be due to specific effects of postnatal maternal care, and not to biological/ behavioral traits inherited from the mother, or due to prenatal programming caused by prenatal stress, as the cross-fostering design controlled for these potential factors. However, we also detected a couple of interesting biological effects suggesting heritable transmission of some phenotypes. The prolonged HPA axis activation during the first 6 postnatal months of life is expected to have long-term consequences for brain, physiological, and behavioral development in MALT offspring.},

	abstract = {Background: The Emory Roybal Center for Dementia Caregiving Mastery (P30AG064200) supports pilot intervention projects designed to enhance informal caregiving mastery and seeks to further their development, following the NIH Stage Model. The Center’s core assertions are that dementia caregiving is heterogeneous in nature and that caregiving role demands are positioned within a variety of intersections involving dementia stage and type, the nature of care tasks, caregiver-care recipient relationships, and/or other social determinants including race/ethnicity, culture, class, and geography. Thus, interventions to develop/enhance caregiving mastery must be designed within the context of these intersections. This presentation demonstrates the resonance of the Center’s central theme and illustrates the wide range of caregiving situations/contexts investigators seek to address. Method: We analyzed the letters of intent (LOI) investigators submitted to the Center In its three years of operation. The LOIs describe context/situation-specific caregiving mastery interventions investigators seek to develop. Result: In three years, the Center received 67 LOIs from investigators in 26 U.S. states. Most (85\%) were from female investigators; the majority were from early-stage (Assistant Professor) investigators (52\%) and investigators from underrepresented groups (54\%). Responses came from 10 different disciplines (including Behavioral Sciences (including Social Work), 14; Nursing, 12; and Medicine, 10). Proposed interventions fell into three broad (sometimes intersecting) categories: specific caregiving populations (e.g., racial/ethnic groups; specific caregiving relationships); specific caregiving challenges (e.g., skilled care tasks, managing delirium or chronic pain, caregiver self-care); and dementia types (e.g., MCI, Lewy Body Disease (LBD), and Frontotemporal Dementia). To date, the Center has provided support for pilot projects aiming to enhance mastery in caregivers of persons with Primary Progressive Aphasia and with LBD and couples living with MCI, among Native American caregivers and those from the LGBTQ community and rural caregivers, and those faced with skilled care tasks and who needed to develop skills through distance means. Conclusion: The Center has supported pilot projects that illustrate the importance of appreciating the heterogeneity of dementia caregiving. The voluminous response to the LOI call demonstrates the salience of the heterogeneity theme and underscores the need for additional work to enhance dementia caregiving mastery in its many contexts.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To introduce the Community Resiliency Model (CRM) as mental well-being support for healthcare workers working through the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial with a no treatment control group. SETTING: Two large urban health systems in the Southern United States between October 2020 and June 2021. PARTICIPANTS: Eligible participants were currently employed as healthcare workers within the participating healthcare systems. 275 employees registered and consented electronically in response to email invitations. 253 participants completed the baseline survey necessary to be randomised and included in analyses. INTERVENTION: Participants were assigned 1:1 to the control or intervention group at the time of registration. Intervention participants were then invited to 1-hour virtual CRM class teaching skills to increase somatic awareness in the context of self and other care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported data were collected rating somatic awareness, well-being, symptoms of stress, work engagement and interprofessional teamwork. RESULTS: Baseline data on the total sample of 275 (53\% nurses) revealed higher symptoms of stress and lower well-being than the general population. The intervention participants who attended a CRM class (56) provided follow-up survey data at 1 week (44) and 3 months (36). Significant improvement for the intervention group at 3 months was reported for the well-being measures (WHO-5, p{\textless}0.0087, d=0.66; Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, p{\textless}0.0004, d=0.66), teamwork measure (p≤0.0002, d=0.41) and stress (Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale, p=0.0058, d=46). CONCLUSION: Baseline results indicate mental health is a concern for healthcare workers. Post intervention findings suggest that CRM is a practical approach to support well-being for healthcare workers during a crisis such as this pandemic. The simple tools that comprise the model can serve as a starting point for or complement self-care strategies to enhance individual resilience and buffer the effects of working in an increasingly stressful work environment.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to explore the preliminary efficacy of trauma-sensitive yoga compared to cognitive processing therapy (CPT) for women Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to military sexual trauma (MST) in a pilot randomized control trial (RCT). We then compared these results to published interim results for the subsequent full-scale RCT. METHOD: The analytic sample included women Veterans (N = 41) with PTSD related to MST accessing healthcare in a southeastern Veterans Affairs Health Care System. The majority were African American, non-Hispanic (80.5 \%). The protocol-driven group interventions, Trauma Center Trauma-Sensitive Yoga (TCTSY; n = 17) and the evidence-based control condition, CPT (n = 24), were delivered weekly for 10 and 12 sessions, respectively. Multilevel linear models (MLM) were used to compare changes over time between the two groups. RESULTS: The primary outcomes presented here are PTSD symptom severity and diagnosis, assessed using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the PTSD Symptom Checklist (PCL) total scores. PTSD symptom severity on both clinician-administered (CAPS) and self-reported (PCL) measures, improved significantly (p {\textless} .005) over time, with large within group effect sizes (0.90-0.99) consistent with the subsequent RCT. Participants in the TCTSY group showed clinically meaningful improvements earlier than the CPT group participants from baseline on the CAPS and PCL Total scores. CONCLUSIONS: Results support published findings of the effectiveness of TCTSY in the treatment for PTSD related to MST among women Veterans, particularly African American women. TCTSY warrants consideration as an adjunctive, precursor, or concurrent treatment to evidence-based psychotherapies. Future research should include patient preference, men with sexual trauma, and civilian populations.},

Strategies to improve the ability of human resource (HR) recruiters to screen and advance qualified candidates for a project will result in improved initiation and execution of the project. OBJECTIVE/GOALS: HR recruiters play a critical role in matching research applicants to the posted job descriptions and presenting a list of top candidates to the PI/hiring manager for interview and hiring consideration. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Creating guidelines to screen for applicant qualification based on resumes when clinical research positions have multiple levels of expertise required is a complex process of discovery, moving from subjective rationale for rating individual resumes to a more structured less biased evaluation process. To improve the hiring process of the research workforce, we successfully developed guidelines for categorizing research coordinator applications by level from beginner to advanced. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Through guideline development, we provide a framework to reduce bias and improve the matching of applicant resumes to job levels for improved selection of top candidates to advance for interviewing. Improved applicant to job matching offers an advantage to reduce hiring time, anticipate training needs, and shorten the timeline to active project engagement. These guidelines can form the basis for initial screening and ultimately matching individual qualities to project-specific needs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although radiation therapy (RT) has been recognized for contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD), it is unknown whether specific doses received by cardiovascular tissues influence development. OBJECTIVE: In this pilot study, we examined the contribution of RT dose distribution on the development of CVD events in patients with cancer within 5 years of RT. METHODS: A retrospective case-controlled design was used matching 28 cases receiving thoracic RT who subsequently developed an adverse CVD event with 28 controls based upon age, gender, and cancer type. Dose volume histograms of nongated computed tomography scans received during RT characterized the dose delivered to the heart. Heart chambers were segmented using an atlas approach, and radiomics features for the segmentation as well as planning dose in each chamber were tabulated for analysis. RESULT: No significant differences were observed in the RT dose statistics between groups, preexisting CVD, nor significant differences of RT doses delivered to distinct chambers of the heart. Cases were found to have greater CVD risk factors at the time of cancer diagnosis. Morphological significant differences for perimeter on border ( P = .043), equivalent spherical radius ( P = .050), and elongation ( P = .038) were observed, with preexisting CVD having the highest values (ie, larger hearts). CONCLUSION: Traditional CVD risk factors were more prevalent in the cases who developed CVD. No differences were observed in doses of RT. Of note, we observed significant differences in heart morphology and mass in known diseased hearts on the pretreatment scans. These new metrics may have implications for the measurement and quantification of CVD.},

AIMS: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Trauma Center Trauma-Sensitive Yoga (TCTSY) for women veterans with PTSD related to MST. METHOD: In this feasibility study, the final sample included women veterans (n = 41) with PTSD related to MST accessing health care in a Veterans Affairs Health Care System in the southeast United States; the majority were African American (n = 33; 80.5\%). Interventions used established protocols of 10 weekly sessions of group TCTSY versus 12 weekly sessions of group Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT). PTSD was assessed via clinical interview and participant report. Additional data collection included multiple participant-reported outcomes commonly associated with PTSD and psychophysiological measures. We also collected data regarding participant satisfaction and feasibility-related feedback from participants and providers. RESULTS: Feasibility and acceptability were evaluated via demand, practicality, fidelity, and acceptability. This was measured by expressed interest, attendance, program completion, barriers to care and satisfaction with treatment, and satisfaction with interventions and data collection. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate the RCT design and TCTSY implementation were feasible; a full-scale RCT was subsequently conducted to determine efficacy of the experimental intervention.

The attention control group was similar to Tele-Savvy in the intervention structure and duration: it consisted of seven weekly group videoconferences and 36 video lessons. Data on outcomes of caregivers and persons living with dementia were collected at baseline and 3 and 6 months postbaseline. Multilevel mixed effects models were used to determine changes in the outcomes. One hundred and eleven caregivers were randomized to the attention control condition (attrition 21.6\%). Eighteen formative assessment interviews focusing on caregivers' experience in the attention control condition were conducted.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A three-armed, waitlist, randomized trial design tested Tele-Savvy, an online adaptation of a successful in-person psychoeducation program, the Savvy Caregiver. Tele-Savvy is delivered over 43 days to groups of 6-8 caregivers in 7 weekly synchronous sessions accompanied by 36 brief asynchronous video lessons. We enrolled 23 cohorts of 15 eligible caregivers (N = 261), randomized 2:2:1 to active, attention control, and usual care arms. We assessed caregiver psychological well-being and caregiving mastery at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Multilevel linear models assessed outcomes over the 3 time points examined. The trial was slightly truncated, with Data and Safety Monitoring Board approval, because of the apparent confounding psychological effects of coronavirus disease 2019 restrictions. RESULTS: Study findings indicate statistically and clinically significant benefits to Tele-Savvy arm caregivers (with moderate to large effect sizes) in the areas of depression, perceived stress, reaction to care recipients' behaviors, and enhancement of caregiver mastery. Expected benefits for caregiver burden and anxiety were not found. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Findings attest to program efficacy and the viability of employing distance means to improve family caregivers' emotional well-being and sense of mastery in the caregiving role over a 6-month period. Next steps entail finding alternate ways to deliver the program to those with connectivity and/or time constraint problems.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The population of persons living with dementia (PLWDs) is increasing, although mainstream dementia care quality is suboptimal. PURPOSE: To identify characteristics associated with: (1) PLWDs' neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life; and (2) distress from neuropsychiatric symptoms and well-being among their family caregivers (N = 49). METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional single-group examination of PLWD and caregivers when they enrolled into a nurse-led dementia-centered primary care clinic. Pearson correlations were run between characteristics of PLWD and caregiver and variables representing PLWD's neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life and their caregivers' well-being. Statistically significant correlations were reported via Cohen d statistics. RESULTS: Caregivers' characteristics associated with higher distress from neuropsychiatric symptoms and diminished well-being included Black race, female gender, younger age, caring for a parent with dementia, and being employed. Characteristics of PLWD associated with caregivers' higher distress and diminished well-being included longer time since dementia onset, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, and non-Alzheimer dementia. Caregivers' characteristics associated with higher neuropsychiatric symptom burden included Black race, female gender, younger age, caring for parent PLWD, and being employed. Characteristics of PLWDs associated with higher neuropsychiatric symptom burden included non-Alzheimer dementia, longer time since dementia onset, more comorbidities, and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index. Finally, a longer time since dementia onset was associated with PLWDs' lower quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Black race, caring for caring for a parent with dementia, younger age, and being employed were characteristics linked to PLWDs' higher neuropsychiatric symptom burden and caregivers' diminished well-being. IMPLICATIONS: Clinicians must assess and intervene with unpaid caregivers who may not appear obviously distressed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk appraisal is essential for hypertensive patients to identify correctly their risk status and take efficient behavioral measures timely to avoid major adverse outcomes. However, hypertensive patients' risk perceptions of CVD events in Ethiopia are unknown. Thus, the study aimed to compare the subjective CVD risk perception level of patients with the nonlaboratory Framingham Risk Score (nl-FRS). METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used. The Attitudes and Beliefs about Cardiovascular Disease Risk Questionnaire and the nl-FRS were used to compare subjective versus objective measures of CVD risk. Agreement between participants' risk perceptions and the nl-FRS were examined using the kappa statistic. Bivariate chi-square test and multinomial logistic regression analyses were run to identify factors associated with risk perceptions. The statistical significance was set at a p-value {\textless} 0.05 level. RESULTS: Participants (n=377) had a mean age of 53.61 ± 12.80-years, range (18-82 years), 51.2\% were males, 42.7\% had less than high school education, 45.1\% achieved target BP control, and mean HTN duration was 8.01 ± 6.07 years. The majority (58.62\%) of the participants had a low subjective risk perception of CVD events (mean 17.79, 95\% CI: 17.43-18.15). Approximately three-fourths (72.4\%) had a moderate nl-FRS risk calculation (mean, 13.84, 95\% CI: 13.36-14.33). Agreement between participants perceived-risk and the nl-FRS was poor (kappa = 0.0002, standard error = 0.023, p =0.99). Participants' CVD risk-perception inaccuracy was also high (76\%) primarily due to underestimation. Hypertension duration, frequency of physician visits, and level of diabetes control were significant predictors of CVD risk underestimation. CONCLUSION: Hypertensive patients had inaccurate and low subjective risk perceptions of CVD events compared to moderate objective risks identified using the nl-FRS. Planned education on HTN and CVD risk factors is essential to improve patients' CVD risk perception to reduce adverse CVD events.},
