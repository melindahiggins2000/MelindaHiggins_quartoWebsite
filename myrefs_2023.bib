	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: First-line treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), ie, trauma-focused therapy, while effective, is limited by low treatment initiation, high dropout, and high treatment refraction. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of Trauma Center Trauma-Sensitive Yoga (TCTSY) vs first-line cognitive processing therapy (CPT) in women veterans with PTSD related to military sexual trauma (MST) and the hypothesis that PTSD outcomes would differ between the interventions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multisite randomized clinical trial was conducted from December 1, 2015, to April 30, 2022, within 2 VA health care systems located in the southeast and northwest. Women veterans aged 22 to 71 years with MST-related PTSD were enrolled and randomized to TCTSY or CPT. INTERVENTIONS: The TCTSY intervention (Hatha-style yoga focusing on interoception and empowerment) consisted of 10 weekly, 60-minute group sessions, and the CPT intervention (cognitive-based therapy targeting modification of negative posttraumatic thoughts) consisted of 12 weekly, 90-minute group sessions. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Sociodemographic data were collected via self-report survey. The primary outcome, PTSD symptom severity, was assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Assessments were conducted at baseline, midintervention, 2 weeks post intervention, and 3 months post intervention. RESULTS: Of 200 women veterans who consented to participate, the intent-to-treat sample comprised 131 participants (mean [SD] age, 48.2 [11.2] years), with 72 randomized to TCTSY and 59 randomized to CPT. Treatment was completed by 47 participants (65.3\%) in the TCTSY group and 27 (45.8\%) in the CPT group, a 42.6\% higher treatment completion rate in the TCTSY group (P = .03). Both treatment groups improved over time on the CAPS-5 (mean [SD] scores at baseline: 36.73 [8.79] for TCTSY and 35.52 [7.49] for CPT; mean [SD] scores at 3 months: 24.03 [11.55] for TCTSY and 22.15 [13.56]) and the PCL-5 (mean [SD] scores at baseline: 49.62 [12.19] for TCTSY and 48.69 [13.62] for CPT; mean [SD] scores at 3 months: 36.97 [17.74] for TCTSY and 31.76 [12.47]) (P {\textless} .001 for time effects). None of the group effects or group-by-time effects were significant. Equivalence analyses of change scores were not significantly different between the TCTSY and CPT groups, and the two one-sided test intervals fell within the equivalence bounds of plus or minus 10 for CAPS-5 for all follow-up time points. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this comparative effectiveness randomized clinical trial, TCTSY was equivalent to CPT in reducing PTSD symptom severity, with both groups improving significantly. The higher treatment completion rate for TCTSY indicates its higher acceptability as an effective and acceptable PTSD treatment for women veterans with PTSD related to MST that could address current VA PTSD treatment limitations.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little is known about where young adults with chronic illness die in the United States and factors associated with place of death. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine place of death and factors associated with place of death for young adults with chronic illness using the most recent national data. METHODS: Our sample ( N = 405,535) from the National Center for Health Statistics Division of Vital Statistics death certificate data (2003-2018) included young adults (age 18-39 years) who died from chronic conditions common in childhood or young adulthood. Conditions were grouped by underlying pathophysiology (oncological, cardiovascular, neuromuscular, metabolic, hematological/immunological, renal, chromosomal/congenital, gastrointestinal, and respiratory). Place of death was dichotomized into acute care (inpatient, outpatient/emergency room, and dead on arrival) or nonacute care (home, hospice, nursing home/long-term care, other, and unknown). Examined factors were gender, year of death, age, race (White, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaskan Native), cause of death, and city of residence population (100,000 or greater and under 100,000). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to examine factors related to place of death. RESULTS: Over half of young adults died in acute care settings. Young adults who were Asian/Pacific Islander or Black or who died from a respiratory or renal cause of death were most likely to die in an acute care setting. Rates of acute care death decreased over the studied years. DISCUSSION: Many young adults died in an acute care setting. Race and cause of death were the most influential factors associated with place of death. Young adults with an oncological cause of death were less likely to die in an acute care setting than patients with other underlying causes. This may indicate that specific care needs or preferences at the end of life may differ in certain disease populations and may affect place of death. Previous research has shown similar results in other developmental populations; however, given the complex psychosocial concerns that often arise during young adulthood, further research is needed to describe how the young adult status may specifically affect place of death.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) receiving chemotherapy often experience psychoneurological symptoms (PNS; ie, fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, pain, and cognitive dysfunction) that negatively impact both patients' and their caregivers' health outcomes. Limited information is available on PNS management for CRC patient and caregiver dyads. OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study are to (1) develop a web-based dyadic intervention for patients with CRC receiving chemotherapy and their caregivers (CRCweb) and (2) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of CRCweb among patient-caregiver dyads in a cancer clinic. METHODS: A mixed methods approach will be used. Semistructured interviews among 8 dyads will be conducted to develop CRCweb. A single-group pre- and posttest clinical trial will be used to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of the intervention (CRCweb) among 20 dyads. Study assessments will be conducted before (T1) and after intervention (T2). Content analysis will be performed for semistructured interviews. Descriptive statistics will be calculated separately for patients and caregivers, and pre-post paired t tests will be used to evaluate treatment effects. RESULTS: This study was funded in November 2022. As of April 2023, we have obtained institutional review board approval and completed clinical trial registration and are currently recruiting patient-caregiver dyads in a cancer clinic. The study is expected to be completed in October 2024. CONCLUSIONS: Developing a web-based dyadic intervention holds great promise to reduce the PNS burden in patients with CRC receiving chemotherapy and their caregivers. The findings from this study will advance intervention development and implementation of symptom management and palliative care for patients with cancer and their caregivers.

	doi = {10.1186/s12884-023-05667-6},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Racial disparities exist in maternal morbidity and mortality, with most of these events occurring in healthy pregnant people. A known driver of these outcomes is unplanned cesarean birth. Less understood is to what extent maternal presenting race/ethnicity is associated with unplanned cesarean birth in healthy laboring people, and if there are differences by race/ethnicity in intrapartum decision-making prior to cesarean birth. METHODS: This secondary analysis of the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be (nuMoM2b) dataset involved nulliparas with no significant health complications at pregnancy onset who had a trial of labor at ≥ 37 weeks with a singleton, non-anomalous fetus in cephalic presentation (N = 5,095). Logistic regression models were used to examine associations between participant-identified presenting race/ethnicity and unplanned cesarean birth. Participant-identified presenting race/ethnicity was used to capture the influence of racism on participant's healthcare experiences. RESULTS: Unplanned cesarean birth occurred in 19.6\% of labors. Rates were significantly higher among Black- (24.1\%) and Hispanic- (24.7\%) compared to white-presenting participants (17.4\%). In adjusted models, white participants had 0.57 (97.5\% CI [0.45-0.73], p {\textless} 0.001) lower odds of unplanned cesarean birth compared to Black-presenting participants, while Hispanic-presenting had similar odds as Black-presenting people. The primary indication for cesarean birth among Black- and Hispanic- compared to white-presenting people was non-reassuring fetal heart rate in the setting of spontaneous labor onset. CONCLUSIONS: Among healthy nulliparas with a trial of labor, white-presenting compared to Black or Hispanic-presenting race/ethnicity was associated with decreased odds of unplanned cesarean birth, even after adjustment for pertinent clinical factors. Future research and interventions should consider how healthcare providers' perception of maternal race/ethnicity may bias care decisions, leading to increased use of surgical birth in low-risk laboring people and racial disparities in birth outcomes.},

	abstract = {This study examined the role of male pubertal maturation on physical growth and development of neurocircuits that regulate stress, emotional and cognitive control using a translational nonhuman primate model. We collected longitudinal data from male macaques between pre- and peri-puberty, including measures of physical growth, pubertal maturation (testicular volume, blood testosterone -T- concentrations) and brain structural and resting-state functional MRI scans to examine developmental changes in amygdala (AMY), hippocampus (HIPPO), prefrontal cortex (PFC), as well as functional connectivity (FC) between those regions. Physical growth and pubertal measures increased from pre- to peri-puberty. The indexes of pubertal maturation -testicular size and T- were correlated at peri-puberty, but not at pre-puberty (23 months). Our findings also showed ICV, AMY, HIPPO and total PFC volumetric growth, but with region-specific changes in PFC. Surprisingly, FC in these neural circuits only showed developmental changes from pre- to peri-puberty for HIPPO-orbitofrontal FC. Finally, testicular size was a better predictor of brain structural maturation than T levels -suggesting gonadal hormones-independent mechanisms-, whereas T was a strong predictor of functional connectivity development. We expect that these neural circuits will show more drastic pubertal-dependent maturation, including stronger associations with pubertal measures later, during and after male puberty.},

	abstract = {Heart failure (HF) is characterized by high symptom burden including, but not limited to fatigue, dyspnea, and edema. Up to 21.5\% of HF patients experience significant depressive symptoms, much higher than 7.1\% in adults without HF. Diet, metabolites, and other inflammatory mechanisms have gained notable attention in recent studies for contributions to symptoms in HF. Symptoms for black adults (B/As) with HF are often influenced by lifestyle factors, which may influence their higher mortality rates; few studies address these factors. Distinguishing the links between key elements with diet, inflammation, and symptoms may bring clarity for new dietary strategies in HF clinical care. The purpose of this integrative review is to examine the existing literature regarding relationships among physiologic pathways in HF along with physical and emotional symptoms in the context of inflammation, dietary intake, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), a biomarker of inflammation, and trimethylamine-N-Oxide (TMAO). Based on available evidence, inflammation may be a key link between physical symptoms, diet, depression, TMAO, and TNF-α in persons with HF and warrants further examination to clarify pathological links to solidify evidence for better guidance with dietary modifications. The literature reviewed in this study demonstrates that more work is needed to examine dietary planning, social support, and differences between men and women in the B/A community. Results of this literature review call attention to the essential, personalized care needs related to symptom monitoring and dietary planning which is expected to decrease symptom burden in the HF population.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is increasing in young adults, and greater understanding of their cardiac risk factors is essential to ensure effective prevention. Given the sex differences in CAD observed in older adults, understanding sex differences in risk factors for this younger group of adults is important. Having insight of cardiac risk factors and sex differences in the young adult population is essential to creating personalized strategies for prevention in nursing care and in this age group. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to determine the differences in CAD risk factors for young adult men and women and examine which factors are related to CAD early in life, ultimately to guide approaches for CAD prevention in primary care. METHODS: In this secondary analysis, 125 017 community-dwelling young adults were evaluated for health behaviors considered as risk factors for CAD. The 2017 Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System database from the Center for Disease Control was utilized. This database contains questions asked of young adults that would help with risk management for chronic diseases like CAD. Young adults in this article were defined as being between 18 and 44 years of age. RESULTS: Men reported more cardiovascular risk factors than women and developed risk factors at an earlier age. Women had greater percentages of obesity and low activity levels. In this population, those with hypertension had the highest odds ratio for developing CAD. CONCLUSIONS: Differences between men and women in CAD risk factors included lifestyle and other chronic conditions. Greater prevention efforts should focus on these differences in young men and women to reduce risk factors and prevent the development of CAD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor sleep quality is highly prevalent in atrial fibrillation (AF) with reported links between worse sleep quality and higher AF severity. Little research has examined whether sleep quality changes after AF ablation despite it being a routinely performed procedure. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate self-reported sleep quality before and after AF ablation and to examine whether sleep quality differs by AF severity or sex. METHODS: This longitudinal pilot study assessed sleep using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at preablation and at 1, 3, and 6 months after ablation. Atrial fibrillation disease severity was assessed by the Canadian Cardiology Society Severity of AF scale. Outcomes were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Spearman ρ correlations, and multilevel longitudinal models. RESULTS: The sample (N = 20) was 55\% female with a mean age of 65 (±7) years. Poor sleep quality (mean Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores {\textgreater} 5) was evident at all time points. Improvement was noted at 3 months (moderate effect size d = 0.49); and negligible further improvement, from 3 to 6 months post ablation. Improvement was seen primarily in male subjects (large effect size d = 0.89 at 3 months), with smaller improvements for female subjects. Although Severity of AF scale scores were not correlated with sleep quality, Severity of AF scale severity scores did significantly improve over time. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AF have poor sleep quality that improves for the first 3 months after AF ablation, with men showing more improvement than women. A more accurate understanding of the sleep challenges after AF ablation could lead to development of more realistic patient education and improve patient self-management.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Sleep disturbance is prevalent in caregivers of persons living with dementia (PLwD). Tele-Savvy, a 7-week virtual psychoeducational intervention, enhances caregivers' competence and self-care, and reduces depression. While not explicitly designed to do so, Tele-Savvy can potentially improve caregivers' disturbed sleep. The present study aimed to examine the longitudinal effects of Tele-Savvy on caregivers' sleep quality and insomnia. METHODS: This was a secondary data analysis of a 3-arm randomized control trial [Tele-Savvy (active treatment), Healthy Living (attention control), and usual care (waitlist control)]. Multilevel mixed modeling with intent-to-treat principles tested for group, time, and group-by-time effects. Effect sizes were estimated for all changes from baseline to the initial 6-month post-intervention point. Following completion of the 6-month post-randomization delay, we examined combined outcomes for Tele-Savvy. RESULTS: Participants (n=137; mean age 64.7 years) were predominantly female (68.6\%) and White (68.6\%). We found no initial group-by-time effects for the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). For the combined Tele-Savvy group, there was a statistically significant improvement in ISI scores across time (p=0.050). The combined Tele-Savvy effect size for PSQI was d=0.126 and ISI was d=0.310. DISCUSSION: Tele-Savvy resulted in a significant long-term reduction in insomnia symptoms in this sample of caregivers of PLwD and demonstrated a positive trend for improvement in their sleep quality. Since sleep disturbance is so prevalent among caregivers of PLwD, the inclusion of sleep health education into psychoeducation caregiver interventions may yield even better outcomes for caregivers.},

The disparity in cancer survival rates within nations is largely a result of disparities in public knowledge, the accessibility of cancer services, diagnosis and treatment. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the survival rate and associated factors among cervical cancer patients in East Africa. METHODS: Literature search was carried out using Google scholar, PubMed/Medline, Embase and CINHAL. Covidence, a web-based program, was used to import studies for review process. PRISMA guidelines were followed. A total of 110 abstracts were identified from electronic sources. There were five duplicate articles removed. We looked at 105 papers' abstracts and titles, and we excluded 78 of them because they did not fit our inclusion criteria. We conducted a full-text analysis of the remaining 27 papers, leaving out 14 researches that did not fit our inclusion requirements. For final review, 13 studies were included. Using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) assessment checklist, methodological quality was evaluated. RESULTS: The included articles were cohort studies. They were conducted in Ethiopia, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Sudan, Tanzania and Rwanda. One-year, two-year, three-year, four-year and five-year overall survival rates ranged from 67\% to 92\%, 55\% to 84\%, 44\% to 53\%, 32\% to 47\%, and 26\% to 43\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The pooled one-year, two-year, three-year, four-year and five-year survival rates of cervical cancer patients in East Africa were 84\%, 71\%, 50\%, 39\% and 36\%, respectively. HIV status, late presentation, treatment modalities, older age and presence of comorbidities were the most commonly mentioned prognostic factors for survival.
