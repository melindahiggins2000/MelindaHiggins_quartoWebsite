	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sudden cardiac arrest is a major cause of death worldwide. Performance of prompt, high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation improves patient outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between patient survival of in-hospital cardiac arrest and 2 independent variables: adherence to resuscitation guidelines and patient severity of illness, as indicated by the number of organ supportive therapies in use before cardiac arrest. METHODS: An observational study was conducted using prospectively collected data from a convenience sample. Cardiopulmonary arrest forms and medical records were evaluated at an academic medical center. Adherence to resuscitation guidelines was measured with the ZOLL R Series monitor/defibrillator using RescueNet Code Review software. The primary outcome was patient survival. RESULTS: Of 200 cases, 37\% of compressions were in the recommended range for rate (100-120/min) and 63.9\% were in range for depth. The average rate was above target 55.7\% of the time. The average depth was above and below target 1.4\% and 34.7\% of the time, respectively. Of the 200 patients, 125 (62.5\%) attained return of spontaneous circulation. Of those, 94 (47\%) were alive 24 hours after resuscitation. Fifty patients (25\%) were discharged from the intensive care unit alive and 47 (23.5\%) were discharged from the hospital alive. CONCLUSIONS: These exploratory data reveal overall survival rates similar to those found in previous studies. The number of pauses greater than 10 seconds during resuscitation was the one consistent factor that impacted survival. Despite availability of an audiovisual feedback system, rescuers continue to perform compressions that are not at optimal rate and depth.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor adherence to hypertensive medication has been suggested to be a major contributor to uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) in African Americans. The impact that social determinants have on the various patient-level factors, including HTN beliefs, mental well-being, and social support, may provide insight into the development and tailoring of culturally targeted interventions, thus improving adherence. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the relationships of exposures to contextualized racial and gendered stressors, social support, and depressive symptoms with HTN illness perceptions and blood pressure (BP) medication adherence. METHODS: Participants (N = 85) were hypertensive African-American women aged 18 to 45 years (mean [SD], 39.2 [5.4] years) recruited from the community setting and outpatient medical clinics in a large metropolitan city. Hypertension illness beliefs were assessed using the 8-item Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire ("How much does your blood pressure affect your life?") and medication adherence was assessed with the 7-item Adherence to Refills and Medication Scale ("How often do you forget to take your BP medicine?"). Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the associations with medication adherence and linear regression analyses were performed to examine the associations of continuous variables and HTN illness perceptions. RESULTS: The sample was predominantly nonadherent (81.2\%). In the adjusted multivariable regression model, systolic BP (odds ratio, 0.95; P = .05) and the "Consequence" dimension of HTN beliefs (odds ratio, 0.76; P = .02) were associated with medication adherence. In the adjusted linear regression model, systolic BP (β = 0.22, P {\textless} .01) and depressive symptoms (β = 1.11, P {\textless} .01) were associated with HTN illness beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing beliefs and the mental well-being before initiating BP medications is essential for adherence and BP control.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: One third of the U.S. adult population is estimated to have prediabetes. Hispanics have a 50\% higher type 2 diabetes (T2DM) death rate compared to non-Hispanic whites, yet low participation in lifestyle change programs, making this subgroup an important target for prevention efforts. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of an exercise intervention implementing the Center for Disease Control and Prevention National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) plus recreational soccer (RS) in Hispanic men. METHODS: Overweight and obese Hispanic men, aged 30-57 years with prediabetes at screening were recruited from the community. Trained soccer coaches led 30-min facilitated discussion of the NDPP modules after each RS session, with two weekly sessions delivered over 12 wks, then once a wk until 24 wks. The 1-h RS sessions followed the Football Fitness curriculum structure. Standardized study assessments included objectively measured physical activity via fitness tracker, physical fitness via validated field tests, global positional system soccer specific metrics and behavior change questionnaires. Mixed models assessed the outcomes as a function of time and cohort and incorporated an unstructured covariance structure to examine the difference between baseline, 12 and 24 wks. All analyses were conducted as intent-to-treat and generated using SAS v 9.4. RESULTS: Hispanic males (n = 41; mean age 41.9 [6.2 SD] years) were obese at baseline (mean BMI 32.7, standard error [0.7]). After 24 wks of the NDPP+RS intervention, there were significant beneficial changes in vertical jump (2.8 [1.3] cm; p = 0.048), agility and lower extremity muscular power (figure 8-run) at 12 wks (-4.7\% change; p = 0.001) and 24 wks (-7.2\% change; p {\textless} 0.0001), predicted VO2 max (12 wks: 1.9\%; p = 0.007; 24 wks 1.0\%; p = 0.036), modified push-ups increased 22\% (p {\textless} 0.0001) at 12 wks and 31\% (p {\textless} 0.0001) at 24 wks, dynamic sit-ups increased 10\% (p = 0.005) at 12 wks and 15\% (p {\textless} 0.0001) at 24 wks. CONCLUSION: Among middle-aged Latino men, broad-ranging significant improvements in physical fitness were observed after 24 wks participating in lifestyle education plus RS in a single arm feasibility trial.},

Changes were examined in caregivers' psychological well-being (perceived stress, depressive symptoms, caregiver burden, and anxiety) and health status and in PLWDs' quality of life and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Data were collected at baseline, then 3 and 6 months post-baseline. Forty-two caregivers completed all 3 assessments. Most variables remained unchanged. Statistically significant improvements in 5 sub-scales of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory were observed: caregivers' distress regarding their PLWDs' delusions and anxiety, and PLWDs' severity of delusions, depression, and total symptom severity.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many patients are discharged with aspirin (ASA) as an anticoagulant after joint replacement surgery. In studies in which ASA was prescribed, doses were frequently missed. Adherence to postoperative ASA regimen is critical to preventing thrombotic complications. This randomized controlled study evaluated the impact of an existing medication adherence smartphone application (app) on adherence to twice daily ASA 81 mg for 35 days after knee or hip arthroplasty. METHODOLOGY: Patients were randomized to either the app (intervention) group or the usual care (control) group. All patients received a baseline interview with a survey and demographics collected prior to randomization, a 36-day follow-up call for phone pill count, and a 6-week in-office interview with surveys and an in-person pill count. A convenience sample of 195 patients enrolled; 122 completed pill counts at both baseline and end of study. Ages ranged from 29 to 89 (mean: 60.4, SD: 10.1) years. The majority had a bachelor's degree or higher (59.3\%), made more than \$75,000 (or were retired; 51.9\%), were of White race (75.9\%), and female (53.8\%). There were no significant demographic differences between the groups. RESULTS: There were no significant group differences in final pill counts, adherence (reasons for missed pills), or ASA Medication self-efficacy scores. However, the intervention group scored significantly higher on the ASA Adherence measure (general ease in and ability to take ASA; p = .020). Higher ASA Adherence scores were associated with lower pill counts at the end of study (better adherence) in the intervention group. There was a high rate of attrition related to failure to bring the ASA to hospital or to the follow-up appointment. CONCLUSIONS: Although there were no significant differences in final pill counts between groups, the app group reported more ease in taking pills. With smartphone use virtually ubiquitous, this project provided an opportunity to educate patients and nurses about how technology can support medication adherence. It was also an excellent opportunity to involve clinical nurses in a funded research project.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a common cause of hospitalization in Medicare. Optimal medication adherence lowers hospitalization risk in HF patients. Although out-of-pocket spending can adversely affect adherence to HF medications, it is unknown whether medication spending ultimately increases hospital use for Medicare beneficiaries with HF. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between out-of-pocket medication payments and HF-related hospital use among Medicare Part D subscribers. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the 2010-12 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. The sample comprised community-dwelling respondents with fee-for-service Medicare, continuous Part D coverage, and self-reported HF (n = 819 participant-year records). The effects of average out-of-pocket payment for a 30-day HF-related prescription on odds and frequency of hospitalization and total inpatient days attributable to HF were estimated. Design-adjusted models adjusted for sociodemographic and health status variables, survey year and censoring, and included a pre-specified interaction of out-of-pocket payment with Medicaid co-eligibility. RESULTS: The interaction term was statistically significant in all the models. For beneficiaries without Medicaid, average out-of-pocket payment per prescription was not significantly associated with odds of HF-related hospitalization (odds ratio = 1.01, 95\% CI = 0.98-1.05, P = .399). The association between out-of-pocket payment and hospitalization frequency was statistically significant (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.02, 95\% CI = 1.00-1.05, P = .048), as was the association between out-of-pocket payment and total inpatient days (IRR = 1.04, 95\% CI = 1.00-1.08, P = .041). For Medicaid co-eligible beneficiaries, the validity of model estimates is limited, because the range of actual out-of-pocket payments was negligible. CONCLUSIONS: Fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries with Part D, self-reported HF, and no supplemental Medicaid tolerated out-of-pocket medication payments without elevated risk of HF-related hospital use, but medication spending modestly increased hospital use intensity. Therefore, Part D plans with higher out-of-pocket requirements for essential HF medications may warrant additional scrutiny.},

	abstract = {Addiction is associated with trauma, and a body-based approach may help attenuate the long-term impacts of trauma, including addiction and mental disorders. The Community Resiliency Model® (CRM) is a novel, simple, body-based set of sensory awareness skills, which focus on “felt-sense” or interoception. We provided a single 5-h Community Resiliency Model® class in an urban drug treatment center for impoverished women in the Southeastern US. Using a pre-post mixed methods design, we collected data from 20 women on well-being, physical symptoms, anger, depression, anxiety, and spirituality. The post-test revealed that participant somatic complaints, anger, and anxiety symptoms had declined significantly, with a moderate to large effect size; well-being increased significantly, with a small effect size. Participants found the skills and concepts of CRM helpful and shared them with others. CRM is a feasible, inexpensive, and acceptable training that may be valuable for persons with addictions.},

	abstract = {Heart failure (HF) is a comorbidity that complicates type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) management and increases the chance of death. However, little is known concerning factors related to diabetes self-efficacy in comorbid HF. This secondary data analysis was aimed at describing sociodemographic and clinical correlates of diabetes self-efficacy in adults with T2D and comorbid HF. A correlational design was used to analyze cross-sectional baseline data from a randomized study of 180 participants that tested a 6-month integrated self-care intervention targeting adults with concomitant HF and T2D. Participants were enrolled from one of four large urban-tertiary hospitals in Atlanta, GA, during 2010-2013. Data were collected from medical records and self-report. We used stepwise multiple linear regressions to examine variables associated with diabetes self-efficacy. The participants' mean age was 58.1 ± 10.7 years and the majority were male (n = 118; 65.6\%) and African American (n = 119; 66.1\%). Good self-rated health and presence of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) had significant positive relationships with diabetes self-efficacy, while taking both oral antiglycemic medication and insulin, history of depression, cardiac pacemaker, and taking digitalis were negatively related. These variables collectively explained 22.4\% of the variation in diabetes self-efficacy. One study implication is that using self-rated health provides a quick, patient-centered assessment to evaluate patient health status. Further studies are warranted to ascertain the pathways linking ICD, pacemaker, and digitalis treatment with diabetes self-efficacy.},

	abstract = {Among 170 adults with sickle cell disease, we evaluated chronic pain impact and disability prevalence, assessed age and gender differences, and identified psychosocial predictors of chronic pain intensity and disability. Most participants had a high level of disability. Chronic pain intensity and disability were significantly associated with pain catastrophizing and chronic pain self-efficacy, and worsened with age. Further research is needed to confirm study findings and develop interventions, including palliative care approaches that address catastrophizing and disability, particularly for young women and middle-aged adults with sickle cell disease. Moreover, consistent clinical assessment of chronic pain and psychosocial health should be implemented.},
