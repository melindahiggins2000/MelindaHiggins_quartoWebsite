	abstract = {The impact on nursing work of patient turnover (admissions, discharges, and transfers) became evident in an ethnographic study of turbulence. The patient turnover data were generated from extensive observations, 21 formal interviews, and a year of admission and discharge records on one medical and one surgical unit. Timing of turnover events on the two units differed, but on both units admissions typically interrupted workflow more than did discharges, clustered admissions were more disruptive than staggered admissions, and patient turnover during change of shift was more disruptive than during medication administration. Understanding the complexity of patient turnover will elucidate the work involved and improve the evidence base for nurse staffing, a key determinant of quality and safety of care.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lowering dietary sodium and adhering to medication regimens are difficult for persons with heart failure (HF). Because these behaviors often occur within the family context, this study evaluated the effects of family education and partnership interventions on dietary sodium (Na) intake and medication adherence (MA). METHODS AND RESULTS: HF patient and family member (FM) dyads (n = 117) were randomized to: usual care (UC), patient-FM education (PFE), or family partnership intervention (FPI). Dietary Na (3-day food record), urinary Na (24-hour urine), and MA (Medication Events Monitoring System) were measured at baseline (BL) before randomization, and at 4 and 8 months. FPI and PFE reduced urinary Na at 4 months, and FPI differed from UC at 8 months (P = .016). Dietary Na decreased from BL to 4 months, with both PFE (P = .04) and FPI (P = .018) lower than UC. The proportion of subjects adherent to Na intake (≤2,500 mg/d) was higher at 8 months in PFE and FPI than in UC (χ(2)(2) = 7.076; P = .029). MA did not differ among groups across time. Both FPI and PFE groups increased HF knowledge immediately after intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary Na intake, but not MA, was improved by PFE and FPI compared with UC. The UC group was less likely to be adherent with dietary Na. Greater efforts to study and incorporate family-focused education and support interventions into HF care are warranted.},

	doi = {10.1111/trf.12158},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that antecedent red blood cell (RBC) transfusions increase the risk for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), the most common gastrointestinal emergency encountered by very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants. The underlying mechanism for this association is unknown. Altered oxygenation of the mesenteric vasculature during RBC transfusion has been hypothesized to contribute to NEC development and was investigated in this study. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Oxygenation patterns among four VLBW infants who developed transfusion-related NEC (TR-NEC) were compared to four VLBW infants with similar gestational age who were transfused but did not develop NEC (non-NEC). Cerebral and mesenteric patterns were recorded before, during, and 48 hours after RBC transfusion using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology. Percentage change from mean baseline regional oxygen saturation values and cerebrosplanchnic oxygenation ratios were analyzed. RESULTS: All TR-NEC infants (24-29 weeks' gestation; 705-1080 g) demonstrated greater variation in mesenteric oxygenation patterns surrounding transfusions than non-NEC infants (27.6-30 weeks' gestation; 980-1210 g). TR-NEC infants received larger mean volumes of total blood (27.75 ± 8.77 mL/kg) than non-NEC infants (15.25 ± 0.5 mL/kg). CONCLUSION: Wide fluctuation and decreases in mesenteric oxygenation patterns are more pronounced in TR-NEC infants, especially before TR-NEC onset, compared to non-NEC infants. Greater total volume of infused blood was associated with TR-NEC in preterm infants. Using NIRS, larger prospective studies are needed to further evaluate potential risk factors for NEC in this high-risk population.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the quality and adequacy of dietary intake in patients attempting to limit sodium. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive analysis of the dietary intake of persons with heart failure (HF) in the Southern United States who have been advised to limit their sodium intake. METHODS: Three-day food diaries were completed by 114 New York Heart Association class II and III persons with HF enrolled in a family partnership intervention study, which were reviewed by a dietitian and analyzed using validated nutritional software. The Harris-Benedict equation for sedentary adults was used to determine macronutrient intake adequacy. Demographic information and clinical data were obtained through patient report and medical record review. RESULTS: Dietary sodium ingestion ranged from 522 to 9251 mg/d (mean [SD], 2671 [1432] mg/d), with 38 (33.3\%) individuals consuming the recommended 2000 mg/d or less in this sample (age, 28-78 years; 64.0\% men; 57.0\% African American). Mean (SD) caloric intake for the total sample was 1674 (636) kcal/d, with participants eating 99\% of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of protein, 63\% of the RDA of carbohydrates, and 89\% of the RDA of fat. Participants eating 2000 mg or less of sodium consumed significantly less calories (P {\textless} .001), protein (P {\textless} .001), carbohydrates (P = .008), and fat (P {\textless} .001), but not fiber (P = .103), compared with those consuming more than 2000 mg of sodium after adjusting for body mass index. When analyzed by amount of sodium consumption, persons ingesting 2000 mg or less of sodium per day ate significantly less grains (P = .001) and meat and beans (P = .004) and had less intake of the micronutrients calcium (P {\textless} .001), zinc (P = .002), and thiamine (P = .05). CONCLUSION: Only one-third of participants with HF who have been instructed on a low-sodium diet reported consuming the RDA of 2000 mg or less, indicating the need for further dietary instruction with a particular focus on modifying the Southern US diet.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.psyneuen.2012.04.021},
	abstract = {A cascade of neuroendocrine events regulates the initiation and progression of female puberty. However, the factors that determine the timing of these events across individuals are still uncertain. While the consequences of puberty on subsequent emotional development and adult behavior have received significant attention, what is less understood are the social and environmental factors that actually alter the initiation and progression of puberty. In order to more fully understand what factors influence pubertal timing in females, the present study quantified social and emotional behavior; stress physiology; and growth and activity measures in juvenile female rhesus monkeys to determine what best predicts eventual puberty. Based on previous reports, we hypothesized that increased agonistic behavior resulting from subordinate status in their natal group, in combination with slowed growth, reduced prosocial behavior, and increased emotional reactivity would predict delayed puberty. The analyses were restricted to behavioral and physiological measures obtained prior to the onset of puberty, defined as menarche. Together, our findings indicate that higher rates of aggression but lower rates of submission received from group mates; slower weight gain; and greater emotional reactivity, evidenced by higher anxiety, distress and appeasing behaviors, and lower cortisol responsivity in response to a potentially threatening situation, predicts delayed puberty. Together the combination of these variables accounted for 58\% of the variance in the age of menarche, 71\% in age at first ovulation, and 45\% in the duration of adolescent sterility. While early puberty may be more advantageous for the individual from a fertility standpoint, it presents significant health risks, including increased risk for a number of estrogen dependent cancers and as well as the emergence of mood disorders during adulthood. On the other hand, it is possible that increased emotional reactivity associated with delayed puberty could persist, increasing the risk for emotional dysregulation to socially challenging situations. The data argue for prospective studies that will determine how emotional reactivity shown to be important for pubertal timing is affected by early social experience and temperament, and how these stress-related variables contribute to body weight accumulation, affecting the neuroendocrine regulation of puberty.},

We hypothesized that the correlates of parents who allow their children aged 9 to 13 years to get the HPV vaccine and those of parents who do not allow vaccination would differ significantly. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was implemented during the school years 2009-2011 in the elementary and middle schools of three rural counties in Georgia. Parents were recruited at school functions to complete an anonymous validated survey. RESULTS: Parents who chose to vaccinate their children or intended to vaccinate were twice as likely to be from a race other than African American and 2.7 times more likely to have a religion other than Baptist. Using stepwise logistic regression and after adjustment for race and religion, we found that parents who had vaccinated or intended to vaccinate had significantly higher scores on perceived barriers (1.02 times more likely to vaccinate) and lower scores on perceived benefits (1.01 times more likely to vaccinate) (model p {\textless} .001). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that healthcare providers in rural areas can increase HPV vaccine uptake and reduce HPV-related cancers by using a multifaceted approach to educating their patients within the context of the patients' cultural values, geographic location, and economic situation. Such an approach could dispel misinformation and increase vaccine uptake.},
