	abstract = {Early preterm infants (EPT) ({\textless}33 6/7 weeks) are at increased risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) but prevalence estimates vary widely across studies. Furthermore, there are very few studies addressing the association between late preterm (LPT) births (34-36 6/7 weeks) and ASDs. To address the question of whether LPT infants carry the same risk for ASDs as full-term infants, this study aimed to estimate the relative probability of an ASD diagnosis using Bayes rule. A retrospective cohort analysis of 406 children was undertaken to look at gestational age, ASDs, and birth history. The application of Bayes rule was used, given that there is not sufficient information about the joint probabilities related to prematurity and autism. Using the estimated gestational age proportions within ASD diagnosis, plus national estimates of ASDs, probabilities for ASDs within a given gestational age were calculated. Among these 406 children with ASDs, 6.7\% were EPT and 10.6\% were LPT. In comparison to full term, EPT children are at 1.9 multiplicative increase in risk (95\% CI [1.3, 2.5]). While the probability of ASDs for LPT children was higher than that for term, the estimated relative risk of the LPT infants was not statistically significant (95\% CI [0.9, 1.5]). EPT infants were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with ASDs compared to their term peers. While the relative probability of ASD diagnosis among children born LPT was not statistically significant in this limited sample, the results indicate a possible elevated risk. A larger cohort is needed to adequately estimate this risk.},

	abstract = {Early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) enables early intervention that improves long term functioning of children with ASD but is often delayed until age of school entry. Few studies have identified factors that affect timely diagnosis. This study addressed how maternal education, race, age, marital status as well as neonatal birth factors affect the age at which a child is diagnosed with ASD. This study involved a retrospective analysis of 664 records of children treated at one of the largest autism treatment centers in the United States from March 1, 2009 to December 30, 2010. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to identify maternal and neonatal factors associated with age of diagnosis. Infant gender, maternal race, marital status, and maternal age were identified as significant factors for predicting the age of ASD diagnosis. In the Cox proportional hazards regression model, only maternal race and marital status were included. Median survival age till diagnosis of children born to married mothers was 53.4 months compared to 57.8 months and 63.7 months of children born to single and divorced or widowed mothers respectively. Median survival age till diagnosis for children of African American mothers was 53.8 months compared to 57.2 months for children of Caucasian mothers. No statistically significant difference of timing of ASD diagnosis was found for children of varying gestational age. Children born to older or married mothers and mothers of minority races were more likely to have an earlier ASD diagnosis. No statistically significant differences in timing of ASD diagnosis were found for children born at varying gestational ages. Identification of these factors has the potential to inform public health outreach aimed at promoting timely ASD diagnosis. This work could enhance clinical practice for timelier diagnoses of ASD by supporting parents and clinicians around the world in identifying risk factors beyond gender and SES and developing strategies to recognize earlier signs of ASD and contribute to improved development outcomes in children with ASD.},

	abstract = {Clinical research to identify effective interventions for decreasing nonactionable alarms has been limited. The objective of this study was to determine if a staff educational program on customizing alarm settings on bedside monitors decreased alarms in a medical intensive care unit (MICU). A preintervention, postintervention, nonequivalent group design was used to evaluate an educational program on alarm management in a convenience sample of MICU nurses. A 15-minute session was provided in a 1-week period. The outcome variable (number of alarms for low oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry [SpO2]) was determined from monitor log files adjusted by patient census. Data were collected for 15 days before and after the intervention. χ2 analysis was used, with P less than .05 considered significant. After 1 week of education, low SpO2 alarms decreased from 502 to 306 alarms per patient monitored per day, a 39\% reduction (P {\textless} .001). Instructions for nurses in the medical intensive care unit on individualizing alarm settings to patients' clinical condition decreased common monitor alarms by 39\%.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The global Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic of 2014/2015 prompted faculty at Emory University to develop an educational program for nursing students to increase EVD knowledge and confidence and decrease concerns about exposure risk. PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of the EVD Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) educational program. METHODS: Informational sessions, online course links, and a targeted, self-directed slide presentation were developed and implemented for the EVD educational program. Three student surveys administered at different time points were used to evaluate the program and change in students' EVD knowledge, confidence in knowledge, and risk concern. DISCUSSION: Implementation of a JiTT educational program effectively achieved our goals to increase EVD knowledge, decrease fear, and enhance student confidence in the ability to discuss EVD risk. These achievements were sustained over time. CONCLUSION: JiTT methodology is an effective strategy for schools of nursing to respond quickly and comprehensively during an unanticipated infectious disease outbreak.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart failure self-care requires confidence in one's ability and motivation to perform a recommended behavior. Most self-care occurs within a family context, yet little is known about the influence of family on heart failure self-care or motivating factors. AIMS: To examine the association of family functioning and the self-care antecedents of confidence and motivation among heart failure participants and determine if a family partnership intervention would promote higher levels of perceived confidence and treatment self-regulation (motivation) at four and eight months compared to patient-family education or usual care groups. METHODS: Heart failure patients (N=117) and a family member were randomized to a family partnership intervention, patient-family education or usual care groups. Measures of patient's perceived family functioning, confidence, motivation for medications and following a low-sodium diet were analyzed. Data were collected at baseline, four and eight months. RESULTS: Family functioning was related to self-care confidence for diet (p=0.02) and autonomous motivation for adhering to their medications (p=0.05) and diet (p=0.2). The family partnership intervention group significantly improved confidence (p=0.05) and motivation (medications (p=0.004; diet p=0.012) at four months, whereas patient-family education group and usual care did not change. CONCLUSION: Perceived confidence and motivation for self-care was enhanced by family partnership intervention, regardless of family functioning. Poor family functioning at baseline contributed to lower confidence. Family functioning should be assessed to guide tailored family-patient interventions for better outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is little consensus among faculty mentoring programs as to best practices. While there are recommendations in the literature to base faculty development programs on gap analyses of faculty ratings of actual and preferred performance in teaching, scholarship and service, no gap analysis was found in the literature. PURPOSE: Thus, the purpose of this study was to develop a survey tool to benchmark school of nursing (SON) faculty mentorship priorities and conduct a gap analysis of how well they were being addressed. METHODS: Senior faculty who lead mentorship as part of their roles in the SON (associate and assistant deans and director of mentorship) developed a survey through (a) asking faculty members for priorities at in-person mentorship seminars, (b) a review of current nursing literature, and (c) input from the SON mentorship advisory board. The final survey included 37 items focused on general job duties, structure of the mentoring program, time management, as well as skills needed for research, teaching, practice, writing and team science. Responses (rated from 0-not important to 5-very high priority) were requested in 4 areas: the first area focused on how high a priority the respondent rated a given item and areas 2 to 4 focused on how well the need was met by one of three resources: their SON primary assigned mentor, other SON resources, or other university resources. DISCUSSION: There were 63 eligible SON faculty to whom the survey was e-mailed with a 60\% (n = 38) response rate. Most of the respondents were clinical track (42.1\%) followed by tenure track (39.5\%) and research track (15.8\%). Half were assistant professors. The percentage of respondents giving a rating of 4 to 5 were calculated and then ranked. Almost all the faculty responding, regardless of track or rank, desired formal mentorship. Among all faculty, the top five priorities were guidance on producing timely publications (70.4\%), mentorship on work-life balance (68\%), mentorship on putting together a promotion package (61.5\%), guidance on test writing (60\%), and utilizing technology in the classroom (60\%). Priorities varied by faculty track. In terms of the gap between mentorship priorities and how well they were being met, the highest gaps overall were for test writing, using technology in the classroom, curriculum development, lecturing, and developing and managing a research team. As with priorities, the gaps between priorities and how well they were being met varied by track. CONCLUSION: The priorities and gap analysis were used to guide career development program activities and to develop a plan for future mentor-mentee training and activities. The survey tool demonstrated face validity, variability, and preliminary utility as one method for assessing and guiding improvements in faculty mentorship.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in lymphoma survivors by sex. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, correlation. SETTING: Large cancer institute in Southeastern United States. PARTICIPANTS: Participants (N = 31) had a mean age ± standard deviation of 47.6 ± 11.4 years; 55\% were male and 84\% were White. Participants averaged 5 years since lymphoma treatment. METHODS: During one research visit, routine laboratory tests and fasting lipid levels, coronary artery calcification computed tomography, echocardiography, comprehensive questionnaires, survivorship clinic, and cardiology consultation were measured. Analysis consisted of nonparametric Mann Whitney, t, chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Comparison of the presence of subclinical cardiovascular disease, calculated cardiovascular disease risk, cardiovascular health knowledge, lifestyle behaviors, symptomatology, and health related quality of life between men and women. RESULTS: Subclinical disease and/or significant cardiovascular disease risk were found in 42\%. Women tended to be slightly older (p = .07), had slightly lower but nonsignificant 10-year calculated risk, and slightly higher vascular age. Subclinical disease was detected in 35\% of our sample; 28.6\% of the women had diastolic dysfunction. Women scored less than men in health-related quality of life based on results of the Short Form Health Survey Physical Functioning (p = .03) and the EQ-5D Index (p = .04). Women had more symptoms (bloating and diarrhea; p {\textless} .05). Those with subclinical disease reported other pain (p {\textless} .01), numbness in hands or feet (p {\textless} .05), and shortness of breath (p {\textless} .05). CONCLUSION: Compared with men, more women than expected had subclinical disease, specifically diastolic dysfunction; less reported functioning and health-related quality of life, and greater symptoms. Of clinical relevance is the need for assessment of symptoms that could herald subclinical disease with timely referral.},

We analyzed baseline data from 193 predominately African American HIV-infected women participating in a behavioral clinical trial. Women were categorized into high/low groups based on levels of adherence and risky behaviors. There was a significant interaction effect for internal motivation for adherence. Women at high risk for poor health and transmitting HIV (low adherence/high risk group) had the lowest levels of internal motivation and also reported more difficult life circumstances. Gender roles, caretaking and reliance on men for economic and other support may promote external versus internal motivation as well as riskier behaviors in this group. The highest levels of internal motivation were found in those with High Adherence/High Risk behaviors. This group was highly knowledgeable about HIV and had the lowest VL. Compared to others, this group seems to tolerate risky behaviors given their high level of adherence. Adherence and risk reduction behaviors are key to individual and public health. Motivation and risk compensation should be addressed when providing interventions to women living with HIV.},
