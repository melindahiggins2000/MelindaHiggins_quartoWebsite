	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adults with congenital heart defects (ACHD) face long-term complications related to prior surgery, abnormal anatomy, and acquired cardiovascular conditions. Although self-care is an important part of chronic illness management, few studies have explored self-care in the ACHD population. The purpose of this study is to describe self-care and its antecedents in the ACHD population. METHODS: Persons with moderate or severe ACHD (N=132) were recruited from a single ACHD center. Self-care (health maintenance behaviors, monitoring and management of symptoms), and potential antecedents including sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, ACHD knowledge, behavioral characteristics (depressive symptoms and self-efficacy), and family-related factors (parental overprotection and perceived family support) were collected via self-report and chart review. Multiple regression was used to identify antecedents of self-care maintenance, monitoring, and management. RESULTS: Only 44.7\%, 27.3\%, and 23.3\% of participants performed adequate levels of self-care maintenance, monitoring and management, respectively. In multiple regression analysis, self-efficacy, education, gender, perceived family support, and comorbidities explained 25\% of the variance in self-care maintenance (R(2)=.248, F(5, 123)=9.44, p{\textless}.001). Age, depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, and NYHA Class explained 23\% of the variance in self-care monitoring (R(2)=.232, F(2, 124)=10.66, p{\textless}.001). Self-efficacy and NYHA Class explained 9\% of the variance in self-care management (R(2)=.094, F(2, 80)=5.27, p=.007). CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of self-care are common among persons with ACHD. Multiple factors, including modifiable factors of self-efficacy, depressive symptoms, and perceived family support, are associated with self-care and should be considered in designing future interventions to improve outcomes in the ACHD population.},

	doi = {10.1177/1474515114541729},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fluid restriction (FR) in persons with heart failure (HF) is often prescribed, yet self-regulation and the troublesome symptom of thirst are difficult for patients to manage. AIMS: The purpose of this pilot study was to test an educational and behavioral intervention (EBI) on adherence with prescribed FR and outcome measures of fluid congestion, symptom distress, and health related quality of life (HRQL). Secondary aims were to describe the relationships between self-reported and objectively measured determinants of fluid status and symptoms, and assess the psychometric properties of piloted instruments, and intervention effect sizes. METHODS: NYHA Class II-IV (n=25, 44-83 years, 56\% male, 20\% minority, mean EF 23.0+11.7\%) participants were randomized to the EBI or attention control (AC) and evaluated at baseline, 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: EBI patients trended toward decreasing fluid ingestion (p=0.08), experienced less HF symptom frequency (p=0.13) and severity (p=0.06), and increased symptoms of thirst (p{\textless}0.01) across time. Whereas HRQL remained stable in the EBI group, it improved in the AC group over time (p=0.01). There were no significant differences in clinical measures of fluid congestion between groups. CONCLUSIONS: These outcomes suggest that patients receiving the EBI drank slightly less fluid, experienced less typical HF symptoms, greater thirst distress and stable HRQOL. Moderate to large effect sizes for the measures used were observed, and outcomes suggest that a randomized trial of various levels of FR would not potentiate fluid congestion but should specifically address preservation of HRQOL and thirst symptoms.},

	doi = {10.1097/NOR.0000000000000143},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prior studies have evaluated only the prolonged use of cryotherapy as a nonpharmacologic pain intervention. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a 30-minute application of cryotherapy at the time pain medication was given after a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) provided better pain relief than analgesic drugs alone. METHODS: A pretest, posttest, randomized controlled trial study design with crossover was used to evaluate the effects of cryotherapy on postoperative pain and satisfaction with pain management. A convenience sample of postoperative knee replacement patients constituted participants in the study. Two sequential episodes of pain requiring analgesic administration were studied in each patient, one with a 30-minute cryotherapy application and the other without cryotherapy. Dependent variables were changes in pain (posttest minus pretest) and level of satisfaction with pain management. Data were analyzed with repeated-measures analysis of variance, with p {\textless} .05 considered significant. RESULTS: During two sequential treatments for postoperative pain, a total of 29 TKA patients received analgesic medication administration alone for one pain episode and analgesic medication administration with a brief cryotherapy administration for the other pain episode. No significant difference between the two treatments was found for changes in pain scores after the treatments or patient satisfaction with pain management (p {\textgreater} .05). The order in which the treatments were provided was found to be significant (p = .02) for scores on patient satisfaction with pain management, with cryotherapy as the treatment for the second pain episode having higher scores than when delivered for the first pain episode. Sixty minutes after analgesic administration with or without cryotherapy, average pain scores remained greater than 7. CONCLUSION: In TKA patients, the short-term application of cryotherapy with analgesic medication administration did not significantly decrease pain or improve patient satisfaction with pain management compared with analgesic medication administration only. Further study is necessary to determine whether short-term cryotherapy shortly after TKA is of benefit to pain relief and patient satisfaction.},

METHODS: Using a single subject analysis design, time series analyses models were constructed for each of the five patients for a period of 180 days to determine correlations between daily measures of patient reported fluid intake, thoracic impedance, and weights, and relationships between patient reported outcomes of symptom burden and health related quality of life over time. RESULTS: Negative relationships were observed between fluid intake and thoracic impedance, and between impedance and weight, while positive correlations were observed between daily fluid intake and weight. CONCLUSIONS: By constructing time series analyses of daily measures of fluid congestion, trends and patterns of fluid congestion emerged which could be used to guide individualized patient care or future research endeavors. Employment of such a specialized analysis technique allows for the elucidation of clinically relevant findings potentially disguised when only evaluating aggregate outcomes of larger studies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore biopsychosocial factors (beliefs, depression, catastrophizing cytokines) in individuals newly diagnosed with lung cancer and no pain to determine their relationship at diagnosis and across time and to determine whether these factors contribute to pain intensity or pain interference with function at pain onset. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A longitudinal, exploratory, pilot study was implemented in a private medical center and a VA medical center in the southeast. Twelve subjects not experiencing pain related to cancer of the lung or its treatment were recruited. A Karnofsky status of 40\% and hemoglobin of 8 g were required. Five questionnaires were completed and 10 mL of blood was drawn at baseline; 4 questionnaires and blood draws were repeated monthly for 5 months. One baseline questionnaire and a pain assessment were added at final. Demographic, clinical, and questionnaire data were summarized; standardized scale scores were calculated. RESULTS: Biopsychosocial scores that were low at baseline increased from T1-T4 but decreased slightly T5-T6. Individuals with higher pain intensity and higher pain interference at final had higher psychosocial scores at baseline than individuals with lower pain intensity and lower pain interference at final. CONCLUSIONS: Unrelated to disease stage, metastasis, or treatment, unique levels of biopsychosocial factors are observed in patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer who report higher levels of pain intensity and higher levels of pain interference at the time pain occurs. Replication studies are needed to validate this response pattern and determine the value of repeated individual assessments.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Persons with concomitant heart failure (HF) and diabetes mellitus (DM) have complicated, often competing, self-care expectations and treatment regimens that may reduce quality of life (QOL). This randomized controlled trial tested an integrated self-care intervention on outcomes of HF and DM QOL, physical function, and physical activity (PA). METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants with HF and DM (n = 134; mean age 57.4 ± 11 years, 66\% men, 69\% minority) were randomized to usual care (control) or intervention. The control group received standard HF and DM educational brochures with follow-up telephone contact. The intervention group received education and counseling on combined HF and DM self-care (diet, medications, self-monitoring, symptoms, and PA) with follow-up home visit and telephone counseling. Measures included questionnaires for HF- and DM-specific and overall QOL, PA frequency, and physical function (6-min walk test [6MWT]) and were obtained at baseline and 3 and 6 months. Analysis included mixed models with a priori post hoc tests. Adjusting for age, body mass index, and comorbidity, the intervention group improved in HF total (P = .002) and physical (P {\textless} .001) QOL scores at 3 months with retention of improvements at 6 months, improved in emotional QOL scores compared with control at 3 months (P = .04), and improved in health status ratings (P = .04) at 6 months compared with baseline. The intervention group improved in 6MWT distance (924 ft to 952 ft; P = .03) whereas the control group declined (834 ft to 775 ft; F1,63 = 6.86; P = .01). The intervention group increased self-reported PA between baseline and 6 months (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: An integrated HF and DM self-care intervention improved perceived HF and general QOL but not DM QOL. Improved physical functioning and self-reported PA were also observed with the integrated self-care intervention. Further study of the HF and DM integrated self-care intervention on other outcomes, such as hospitalization and cost, is warranted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Persons with concomitant heart failure (HF) and diabetes mellitus constitute a growing population whose quality of life is encumbered with worse clinical outcomes as well as high health resource use (HRU) and costs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Extensive data on HRU and costs were collected as part of a prospective cost-effectiveness analysis of a self-care intervention to improve outcomes in persons with both HF and diabetes. HRU costs were assigned from a Medicare reimbursement perspective. Patients (n = 134) randomized to the self-care intervention and those receiving usual care/attention control were followed for 6 months, revealing significant differences in the number of hospitalization days and associated costs between groups. The mean number of inpatient days was 3 with bootstrapped bias-corrected (BCa) confidence intervals (CIs) of 1.8-4.4 d for the intervention group and 7.3 d (BCa CI 4.1-10.9 d) in the control group: P = .044.

	abstract = {We sought to examine the course of adherence and cognition in HIV-infected individuals with either cocaine or heroin dependence and investigate independent predictors of cognition change. A prospective study over six months was undertaken in which adherence was measured by monthly electronic pill cap monitoring (Medication Event Monitoring System), while a comprehensive neuropsychological battery resulting in a composite score (NPZ8) was performed at baseline and six months. Multivariable regression models were performed in order to determine independent associations with change in cognition. There were 101 subjects at baseline, of whom 62\% were male and 83\% were non-Hispanic black. 46.6\% of subjects at baseline had completed high school, 36.6\% reported active cocaine use during the course of the study, and 0\% reported active heroin use during the course of the study. 66 subjects completed the final cognitive assessment at six months. Subjects had markedly impaired cognitive function at baseline (NPZ8 -1.49) which persisted at six months (NPZ8 -1.47) in the group of study completers. There was an average monthly decrease in adherence of -2.91\% overall (p = 0.008). In the multivariable model, each of the following variables: baseline cognition (R(2) change = 0.121, p = 0.006), cocaine use during the study (R(2) change = 0.059, p = 0.046), and monthly adherence change (R(2) change = 0.078, p = 0.018) independently contributed to NPZ8 change with an overall R(2) change = 0.219 (p = 0.001). This study shows an overall decrease in adherence over time in this population of subjects with a history of drug dependence. Active cocaine use, baseline cognition, and temporal adherence changes independently contributed to changes in cognition. Further study on enhancing adherence, cognition, and limiting drug abuse are warranted in this subgroup of HIV-infected individuals.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate two methods of rewarming newborns after the first bath: radiant rewarming and skin-to-skin maternal newborn contact. DESIGN: A nonrandomized clinical trial in which mothers chose the rewarming method, with 200 participants in the skin-to-skin rewarming group (experimental condition), and 200 in the radiant rewarming group (control). SETTING: A teaching hospital in the Southeast United States. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy, term infants after vaginal delivery. METHODS: Newborn temperatures were taken immediately prior to the bath (T1), and 30 minutes (T2) and 60 minutes (T3) after the bath. Descriptive statistics and t tests were used to determine differences between groups and between time points. Logistic regression was employed to assess risk factors for newborns with temperatures less than 36.4°C 30 minutes after the bath. RESULTS: Because 96 of the first 100 mothers chose skin-to-skin rewarming, we concluded the study early and analyzed the data. Of the 96 mothers who chose skin-to-skin, 91 infants were successfully rewarmed and five required rescue rewarming under the radiant warmer. Careful review of newborns requiring rescuing showed inadequate skin-to-skin contact or removal of the protective covering. In this sample, African American mothers were significantly younger, had smaller newborns, and their newborns had lower temperatures than non-African American newborns. CONCLUSIONS: Given a choice, mothers overwhelmingly preferred skin-to-skin rewarming. Newborns can safely rewarm skin-to-skin if staff pay special attention to how they are positioning the newborn and recheck mother and newborn frequently. The unexpected finding of racial differences in maternal and newborn characteristics will require further investigation.},

PURPOSE: This study explores the severity and ways in which NSP interferes with activities 48 hours and 6-7 weeks post surgery. ANALYSIS: Univariate and multivariate analyses were used. The mean score for intensity at 48 hours was 1.78, and at 6-7 weeks it was 1.15. The mean score for interference with activities at 48 hours was 1.62 and at 6-7 weeks it was 0.91. Highest NSP pain interference at 48 hours was for "activity," "sleep," and "enjoyment of life." At 6-7 weeks, the highest scores were for "activity," "sleep," and "walking." No significant differences were noted for age, race, education, or gender. IMPLICATIONS: Although rated "mild," this pain should be addressed. The NSP indicates a baseline of chronic and persistent pain, which is an opportunity to work with our patients to mitigate this pain. Total knee arthroplasty, a common and effective treatment for painful knee conditions attributed to various forms of arthritis, is known to be a painful surgical procedure. Two of the major concerns voiced by patients awaiting TKA are about postoperative pain management and rehabilitation efforts after the procedure (). Healthcare providers offer a range of methods and strategies to deal with postoperative TKA pain, yet to date no single method offers complete satisfaction (; ; ; ).},

	abstract = {Social subordination in macaque females is a known chronic stressor and previous studies have shown that socially subordinate female rhesus monkeys consume fewer kilocalories than dominant animals when a typical laboratory chow diet is available. However, in a rich dietary environment that provides access to chow in combination with a more palatable diet (i.e. high in fat and refined sugar), subordinate animals consume significantly more daily kilocalories than dominant conspecifics. Substantial literature is available supporting the role of stress hormone signals in shaping dietary preferences and promoting the consumption of palatable, energy-dense foods. The present study was conducted using stable groups of adult female rhesus monkeys to test the hypothesis that pharmacological treatment with a brain penetrable corticotrophin-releasing factor type 1 receptor (CRF1) antagonist would attenuate the stress-induced consumption of a palatable diet among subordinate animals in a rich dietary environment but would be without effect in dominant females. The results show that administration of the CRF1 receptor antagonist significantly reduced daily caloric intake of both available diets among subordinate females compared to dominant females. Importantly, multiple regression analyses showed that the attenuation in caloric intake in response to Antalarmin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) was significantly predicted by the frequency of submissive and aggressive behaviour emitted by females, independent of social status. Taken together, the findings support the involvement of activation of CRF1 receptors in the stress-induced consumption of excess calories in a rich dietary environment and also support the growing literature concerning the importance of CRF for sustaining emotional feeding.},

	abstract = {Stigma has become a gendered phenomenon that affects increasing numbers of HIV-infected women worldwide. This study examined the role of age as a possible moderator of the relationship between stigma and antiretroviral therapy adherence, CD4\% and viral load among 120 HIV-infected women. A secondary analysis was conducted using data from the Keeping Healthy and Active with Risk Reduction and Medication Adherence (KHARMA) Project, an National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded randomized controlled trial to improve Antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence and reduce risky behaviors in HIV-infected women at five clinical sites in a South-eastern city from 2005 to 2008. Stigma was measured using the Perceived Personal Stigma of Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) scale. Among participants {\textless}50 years old (n=90), age was significantly associated with viral load (rho=-.24, p=.02) and stigma was negatively associated with CD4\% (r =-.26, p=.02). For the 30 participants {\textgreater}50 years old, age was not significantly associated with viral load, stigma or CD4\%, and there was no significant association between stigma and CD4\% (r=.07, p=.70). These findings indicate the need for further study regarding this potential moderating effect and possible interventions to address the susceptibility of younger women to the harmful effects of stigma.},
