	abstract = {The electronic health records (EHR) infrastructure offers a tremendous resource for identifying controls who match the characteristics of study participants in a single-arm trial. The objectives are to (1) demonstrate the feasibility of curating a synthetic control group for an existing study cohort through EHR data extraction and (2) evaluate the effect of a lifestyle intervention on selected cardiovascular health metrics. A total of 711 university employees were recruited between 2008 and 2012 to participate in a health partner intervention to improve cardiovascular health and were followed for five years. Data of nearly 8000 eligible subjects were extracted from the EHR to create a synthetic control cohort during the same study period. To minimize confounding, crude comparison, exact matching, propensity score matching, and doubly robust estimation were used to compare the selected cardiovascular health metrics at 1 and 5 years of follow-up. Blood pressure and body mass index improved in the intervention group compared to the EHR synthetic controls. The findings of changes in lipid measurements were somewhat unexpected. When analyzing the subgroup without lipid-lowering medications, the intervention group exhibited better control of cholesterol levels over time than did our synthetic controls. Some measurements in the EHR system may be more robust for synthetic selection than others. EHR synthetic controls can provide an alternative to estimate intervention effects appropriately in single-arm studies for these measurements.},

	abstract = {Aims: One third of the U.S. adult population is estimated to have obesity-associated prediabetes. Hispanics have a 50\% higher type 2 diabetes death rate compared to non-Hispanic whites, yet low participation in lifestyle change programs, making this subgroup an important target for prevention. Our objective was to determine the feasibility and the effects of an intervention implementing the Center for Disease Control and Prevention National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) plus recreational soccer (RS) in Hispanic men. Methods: Overweight and obese Hispanic men, aged 30-57 years with prediabetes at screening were recruited (n = 41). Trained soccer coaches led 30-min facilitated discussion of the NDPP modules after each RS session, with two sessions per week for 12 weeks and once per week for the following 12 weeks. The 1-h RS sessions followed the Football Fitness curriculum. Assessments included body mass index, waist circumference, bioelectrical impedance analysis (InBody 270), blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and validated physical fitness tests. Multilevel mixed models assessed the outcomes as a function of time and cohort and incorporated an unstructured covariance structure to examine the changes from baseline to 24 weeks. All analyses were conducted as intent-to-treat using SAS v 9.4. Results: Hispanic males (n = 41; mean age 41.7 [0.1] years) were obese at baseline (mean BMI 32.7, standard error of mean [0.7], mean weight 93.9 [2.2] kg). Attendance rate was 65\% overall at 12 weeks but differed between cohorts. Five mild injuries occurred over the trial. After 24 weeks of the NDPP+RS intervention, there were significant decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (\%change -4.7[SE 2.4]; 95\% CI [-11.5, -1.7] and -6.1 [1.7] mmHg; [-9.6, -2.6], respectively), HbA1c (-0.2 [0.1]; [-0.3, -0.1]), Despite significant reductions in weight (-3.8 [0.7]; [-5.2, -2.5]), waist circumference (-6.6 [0.7] cm; [-8.0, -5.1]), body fat \% (-1.9 [0.5]; [-2.8, -1.0]), lean body mass was preserved (-0.9 [0.3]; [-1.6, -0.2]). Conclusion: A 24-week soccer-based adaptation of the Diabetes Prevention Program is safe and feasible among middle-aged Latino men.},

	abstract = {Greater family caregiver exposure to uncontrolled patient symptoms is predictive of greater caregiver psychological and physiological stress in dementia and other chronic illnesses, but these phenomena have not been well-studied in heart failure (HF) - a disease with high symptom burden. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that worse patient functional status (as reflected by increasing HF symptoms) would be associated with elevated psychological and physiological stress for the caregiver. This was a secondary analysis of data from 125 HF caregivers in the Caregiver Opportunities for Optimizing Lifestyle (COOL) study. Psychological stress was measured on four dimensions: care-related strain/burden (Oberst Caregiving Burden Scale), depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Index), and general stress (Perceived Stress Scale). Physiological stress was measured by markers of HPA axis function (elevated cortisol awakening response [CAR]), endothelial dysfunction (increased PAI-1), and inflammation (increased IL-6, hsCRP). HF patient functional status was quantified by caregiver assessment of New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class. Generalized linear models were used to test associations between patient NYHA Class and stress (one model per indicator). NYHA Class (ordinal) was backwards difference coded in each model to examine caregiver stress in relation to increasing levels of HF severity. Caregivers were mostly female and in their mid-fifties, with a slight majority of the sample being African American and the patient's spouse. Overall, patient functional status was associated with greater caregiver psychological and physiological stress. In terms of psychological stress, higher NYHA Class was significantly associated with greater caregiver anxiety and general stress, but not with caregiver burden or depression. In terms of physiological stress, higher NYHA Class was associated with elevated markers in all models (elevated CAR and higher IL-6, hsCRP, and PAI-1). Across models, most associations between NYHA Class and stress were present at relatively early stages of functional limitation (i.e. Class II), while others emerged when functional limitations became more severe. To inform timing and mechanisms for much-needed caregiver interventions, research is needed to determine which aspects of HF symptomatology are most stressful for caregivers across the HF trajectory.},

PURPOSE: The purpose is of this project was to evaluate the implementation of an integrated mental health and acute care clinical model on a dedicated education unit (DEU). METHODS: In this pilot project, students provided dually focused medical and mental health care on assigned patients. A preclass and postclass survey measured their perceptions of mental health competency. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups (integrated model on the DEU compared with a traditional experience on an acute care and inpatient behavioral health unit). All groups reported increased mental health competency. CONCLUSIONS: Both groups showed similar improvements from the preclass to the postclass survey on perceived competence, suggesting that an integrated acute care and mental health clinical practicum may be equivalent to the traditional model.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Front-line workers (FLW) are at risk for secondary traumatic stress, burnout, and related psychiatric sequelae: depression, anxiety, suicidality, posttraumatic stress disorder, and sleep and substance use disorders. FLW are in need of self-care programs to support their mental health. METHODS: Quasi-experimental study to assess the impact of a simple mental well-being and emotional regulation training, the Community Resiliency Model (CRM), using a convenience sample of FLW. Baseline scores of mental well-being and stress measures were compared with follow-up scores at 3 time points. Outcomes were psychological wellness (World Health Organization-5 Well-being Index); resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10); traumatic stress (Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale); physical symptoms (Somatic Symptom Scale-8). RESULTS: Of the 104 participants who enrolled and attended the CRM training, 73 (70.2\%) completed at least 1 posttest. Well-being scores increased at 1 year with a small-moderate effect size (Cohen d=0.32). Resilience scores increased with a small-moderate effect size by 1 year (Cohen d=0.36). Secondary traumatic stress scores declined, with the largest effect at 1 week (Cohen d=0.49). Somatic symptoms decreased at each posttest, with the largest change occurring from baseline to 1 week (d=0.39). Participants reported an awareness of body sensations helped them when overwhelmed as a means of calming themselves. CONCLUSIONS: After a 3-hour CRM training, participants reported improved mental well-being and decreased secondary traumatic stress and somatic symptoms. This simple body awareness intervention may be a good resource during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

	abstract = {In the operating room (OR), opaque drapes are hung between the anesthesia workstation and the operating table. Because OR teams are transient and hierarchical, social order is continuously being negotiated around this partition. We hypothesized that drape transparency, a tool for reimagining the physical and symbolic confines of the OR, might alter behavior. Due to the proximity of anesthesia providers to the drape, we examined how the drape’s transparency affected “social” and “case-related” communication between them and clinicians from surgery and nursing. We observed 58 surgical cases using an OR ethogram to document interprofessional communications (344 exchanges) involving the anesthesia provider. The effect of the type drape showed a statistically significant, GzMLM F(1, 342) = 4.924, p =.027, increase only for “social” communication. The frequency of “social” communication, known to enhance collegiality, was greater when a transparent drape was substituted for the opaque drape (34.9\% vs. 21.3\%, respectively).},

	abstract = {Objective: To conduct an interim analysis of data collected from an ongoing multisite randomized clinical trial (RCT) assessing the effectiveness of Trauma Center Trauma-Sensitive Yoga (TCTSY) for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among women veterans with PTSD related to military sexual trauma (MST). The purpose of the interim analysis was to assess outcomes from the primary site, which is geographically, demographically, culturally, and procedurally distinct from the second site. Design: RCT was conducted within a Veterans Administration Health Care System. Data collection included preintervention through 3 months postintervention. Participants: Enrollment for the main site was 152 women. The sample size for the intent-to-treat analysis was 104. The majority were African American (91.3\%) with a mean age of 48.46 years. Intervention: The TCTSY intervention (n = 58) was conducted by TCTSY-certified yoga facilitators and consisted of 10 weekly 60-min group sessions. The control intervention, cognitive processing therapy (CPT; n = 46), consisted of 12 90-min weekly group sessions conducted per Veterans Administration protocol by clinicians in the PTSD Clinic. Outcome measures: The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) was used to assess current PTSD diagnosis and symptom severity, including overall PTSD and four symptom clusters. The PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) was used to obtain self-report of PTSD symptom severity, including total score and four symptom clusters. Results: The findings reported here are interim results from one clinical site. For both the CAPS-5 and PCL-5, total scores and all four criterion scores decreased significantly (p {\textless} 0.01) over time in all five multilevel linear models within both TCTSY and CPT groups, without significant differences between groups. There were clinically meaningful improvements seen for both TCTSY and CPT with 51.1\%-64.3\% of TCTSY subjects and 43.5\%-73.7\% of CPT decreasing their CAPS-5 scores by 10 points or more. Effect sizes for total symptom severity were large for TCTSY (Cohen's d = 1.10-1.18) and CPT (Cohen's d = 0.90-1.40). Intervention completion was higher in TCTSY (60.3\%) than in CPT (34.8\%). Symptom improvement occurred earlier for TCTSY (midintervention) than for CPT (2 weeks postintervention). Safety: There were no unanticipated adverse events in this study. Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that TCTSY may be an effective treatment for PTSD that yields symptom improvement more quickly, has higher retention than CPT, and has a sustained effect. TCTSY may be an effective alternative to trauma-focused therapy for women veterans with PTSD related to MST. The study is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (CTR no.: NCT02640690).},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Historically, stillbirth risk factors are more prevalent among non-Hispanic Black women than non-Hispanic White women, including age {\textless} 20, lower formal educational attainment, prepregnancy obesity, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, short interpregnancy interval, small for gestational age newborn, late prenatal care, and previous cesarean birth. We examined whether these disparities have changed since 2011 and identified a group of risk factors that differed between Black women and White women when accounting for correlations among variables. METHODS: In a random sample of 315 stillbirths from the National Center for Health Statistics' 2016 fetal death data, Black women and White women were compared for each risk factor using t-tests or chi-square tests. Variables with p ≤ .20 were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance. RESULTS: In this sample, Black women experiencing stillbirth were less likely to have a Bachelor's degree (12.94\% vs. 28.49\%, p = .04), and more likely to be obese (44.5\% vs. 29.1\%, p = .01) than White women. Multivariate analysis accounting for correlations among variables showed a group of risk factors that differed between Black women and White women: age {\textless} 20, lower education, prepregnancy obesity, hypertension (chronic and pregnancy-associated), nulliparity before stillbirth, and earlier gestation. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Less formal education, obesity, age {\textless}20, hypertension, chronic and pregnancy-associated, nulliparity, and earlier gestation are important to consider in multilevel stillbirth prevention interventions to decrease racial disparity in stillbirth. Respectfully listening to women and taking their concerns seriously is one way nurses and other health care providers can promote equity in health outcomes for childbearing women.},

	abstract = {Refugee women face numerous and unique barriers to sexual and reproductive healthcare and can experience worse pregnancy-related outcomes compared with U.S.-born and other immigrant women. Community-based, culturally tailored programs like Embrace Refugee Birth Support may improve refugee access to healthcare and health outcomes, but empirical study is needed to evaluate programmatic benefits. This community-engaged research study is led by the Georgia Doula Access Working Group, including a partnership between academic researchers, Emory Decatur Hospital nurses, and Embrace. We analyzed hospital clinical records (N = 9,136) from 2016 to 2018 to assess pregnancy-related outcomes of Embrace participants (n = 113) and a comparison group of women from the same community and racial/ethnic backgrounds (n = 9,023). We controlled for race, language, maternal age, parity, insurance status, preeclampsia, and diabetes. Embrace participation was significantly associated with 48\% lower odds of labor induction (OR = 0.52, p = 0.025) and 65\% higher odds of exclusive breastfeeding intentions (OR = 1.65, p = 0.028). Embrace showed positive but non-significant trends for reduced cesarean delivery (OR = 0.83, p = 0.411), higher full-term gestational age (OR = 1.49, p = 0.329), and reduced low birthweight (OR = 0.77, p = 0.55). We conclude that community-based, culturally tailored pregnancy support programs like Embrace can meet the complex needs of refugee women. Additionally, community-engaged, cross-sector research approaches could ensure the inclusion of both community and clinical perspectives in research design, implementation, and dissemination.},
