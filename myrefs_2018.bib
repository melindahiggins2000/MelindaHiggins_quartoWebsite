	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate temperature measurement in patients with cancer is critical. Many patients are neutropenic; therefore, fever represents an oncologic emergency, and, in many cases, it can be the only indication of a life-threatening infection. Although oral thermometers most closely represent true core temperature, patients may have barriers to oral thermometry. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of two alternative, noninvasive thermometers (tympanic and temporal artery) by comparing them to an oral thermometer. METHODS: A method-comparison study design was used. Each participant received three temperature measurements. The dependent variable was the difference in temperature between the test thermometers and the oral thermometer. FINDINGS: The results suggest that neither of the test thermometers accurately represented core temperature, particularly in febrile patients. Both the tympanic and temporal artery thermometers became less accurate as oral temperature increased.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of a personalized, 16-week community-based physical activity intervention for adolescents with diabetes or obesity and examine the weekly patterns of adherence to the intervention. METHODS: Physical activity adherence was evaluated throughout the intervention using accelerometers in 46 adolescents with type 1 diabetes (N = 22), type 2 diabetes (N = 12), or obesity (N = 12) (age, 14.4 ± 1.5 years; 56.5\% female; 61\% Hispanic). Of these, 39 completed the intervention, and 7 did not. RESULTS: There were no differences in baseline anthropometric characteristics or fitness between the completers versus noncompleters. Completers began above 1060 metabolic equivalent (MET) min/wk-1and stayed above 900 MET min/wk-1 for 4 weeks and declined 39 MET min/wk-1 until end of study. Noncompleters began at 924 MET min/wk-1 yet dropped below 800 MET min/wk-1 by end of week 1 and declined an average of 151 MET min/wk-1. Interestingly, self-report of barriers to activity were higher in completers versus noncompleters. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight that adolescents completing the intervention could sustain a prescribed level of personalized activity for at least 1 month but had steadfast declines in weekly activity. Even with individualized programs, factors other than barriers to activity need to be considered when designing approaches to physical activity adherence for adolescents with diabetes or obesity.},

	abstract = {The Integrated Memory Care Clinic (IMCC) is a patient-centered medical home as defined by the National Committee for Quality Assurance directed by advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) caring for persons living with dementia (PLWD); physicians provide specialty consultation but do not direct care or care planning. The IMCC incorporates geriatric nursing, social work, and APRNs from neurology, gerontology, palliative care, and geriatric psychiatry. APRNs provide comprehensive, coordinated primary care for dementia, other chronic conditions, and minor acute illnesses. Partnering with PLWD and families and taking a palliative-oriented, dementia-informed medical home approach, the IMCC aims to reduce dementia burden. This study describes the first 12 months of IMCC's operation with 139 enrolled PLWD-caregiver dyads. All patients have a diagnosis of dementia or mild cognitive impairment; most have Alzheimer's disease (53.2\%). Patients have an average of 5.8 medical conditions and 6.9 prescriptions; 38.1\% have an advanced directive, a medical power of attorney, or a living will. Mean age is 78.6, 63.3\% are female, and 30.9\% are African American. Mean Montreal Cognitive Assessment score is 12.6. Most require assistance in activities of daily living. Many display neuropsychiatric symptoms. The most prevalent comorbidities are hypertension, dyslipidemia, and depression. The rate of ambulatory-sensitive hospitalizations declined from 6.7\% in December 2015 to less than 1\% in May 2016. Caregivers were highly satisfied. We observed nonsignificant improvements in neuropsychiatric symptom severity (p=.07), caregiver distress (p=.69), and caregiver competence (p=.18). IMCC is a novel care model for PLWD and their caregivers and may be a more sustainable model than traditional primary care for this growing vulnerable population.

METHODS: A convenience sample of 22 caregivers from the Atlanta VA and 42 caregivers from 14 different states enrolled in Tele-Savvy. Pre- and post-program evaluations assessed caregiver burden, caregiver competency, and frequency of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). RESULTS: Fifty-seven caregivers completed the 6-week Tele-Savvy program. Caregivers whose care recipients exhibited higher average BPSD frequency at baseline demonstrated significantly greater burden decreases post-program. Caregivers of care recipients in more advanced dementia stages demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in caregiver competence. DISCUSSION: The results point to the feasibility of achieving significant results in caregivers' well-being and care recipients' BPSD with a fully online program. Tele-Savvy may be particularly efficacious for caregivers whose care recipients exhibit higher BPSD frequency and are in later dementia stages.},

	abstract = {Operating rooms (ORs) are inhabited by hierarchical, mixed-gender clinical teams that are often prone to conflict. In evolutionary terms, one expects more within- than between-gender rivalries, especially since the OR is a place where all sorts of social interactions occur, not merely technical communications. To document the full range of behavior, the present study used ethological observation techniques, recording live all social behavior by the team. Using an ethogram, 6,348 spontaneous social interactions and nontechnical communications were timestamped during 200 surgical procedures. Cooperation sequences (59.0\%) were more frequent than conflict sequences (2.8\%), which ranged from constructive differences of opinion to discord and distraction that could jeopardize patient safety. Behavior varied by clinical role and with the gender composition in the OR. Conflict was initiated mostly down the hierarchy between individuals several ranks apart. Cooperation tended to increase with a rising proportion of females in the OR, but the most pronounced effect concerned the interaction between both genders. If the attending surgeon's gender differed from that of the majority of other personnel in the OR, cooperation was significantly more common.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The African Health Professions Regulatory Collaborative (ARC) was launched in 2011 to support countries in East, Central, and Southern Africa to safely and sustainably expand HIV service delivery by nurses and midwives. While the World Health Organization recommended nurse initiated and managed antiretroviral therapy, many countries in this region had not updated their national regulations to ensure nurses and midwives were authorized and trained to provide essential HIV services. For four years, ARC awarded annual grants, convened regional meetings, and provided technical assistance to country teams of nursing and midwifery leaders to improve national regulations related to safe HIV service delivery. We examined the impact of the program on national regulations and the leadership and organizational capacity of country teams. METHODS: Data was collected to quantify the level of participation in ARC by each country (number of grants received, number of regional meetings attended, and amount of technical assistance received). The level of participation was analyzed according to two primary outcome measures: 1) changes in national regulations and 2) improvements in leadership and organizational capacity of country teams. Changes in national regulations were defined as advancement of one "stage" on a capability maturity model; nursing and midwifery leadership and organizational capacity was measured by a group survey at the end of the program. RESULTS: Seventeen countries participated in ARC between 2012 and 2016. Thirty-three grants were awarded; the majority addressed continuing professional development (20; 61\%) and scopes of practice (6; 18\%). Fourteen countries (representing approximately two-thirds of grants) progressed at least one stage on the capability maturity model. There were significant increases in all five domains of leadership and organizational capacity (p {\textless} 0.01). The number of grants (Kendall's tau = 0.56, p = 0.02), duration of technical assistance (Kendall's tau = 0.50, p = 0.03), and number of learning sessions attended (Kendall's tau = 0.46, p = 0.04) were significantly associated with improvements in in-country collaboration between nursing and midwifery organizations. CONCLUSIONS: The ARC program improved national nursing regulations in participating countries and increased reported leadership, organizational capacity, and collaboration among national nursing and midwifery organizations. These changes help ensure national policies and professional regulations underpin nurse initiated and managed treatment for people living with HIV.},

	abstract = {Many informal caregivers of persons with dementia suffer adverse health consequences. Although established psychoeducation programs are known to benefit caregivers, attending in-person programs is challenging for them. To address this challenge, the Savvy Caregiver Program, an evidence-based psychoeducation program with demonstrated effectiveness for caregiving and disease-related outcomes, was transformed into an on-line program, Tele-Savvy. This article describes the rationale for and design of a prospective longitudinal randomized controlled trial (targeted N = 215), currently underway. The trial aims to establish Tele-Savvy's efficacy in (i) reducing the negative effects of caregiving on caregivers; (ii) promoting care recipients' quality of life; (iii) improving caregiver mastery; and to explore (iv) Tele-Savvy's efficacy among caregivers of different races/ethnicities. The mediating role of mastery will be assessed. Participants are randomized to the active condition (immediate Tele-Savvy participation), attention control, or usual care. Participants in the two latter conditions will complete Tele-Savvy 6 months post-baseline. Multilevel mixed effects models will be used to examine changes in outcomes and to model group by time (months since baseline) interactions. The exploratory aim will be addressed using analysis of covariance and qualitative analysis. This trial's results may be used by healthcare and community organizations to implement Tele-Savvy in dementia care, increasing caregivers' access to this evidence-based intervention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Since first being published in 2009, the Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test (AHFKT) has proven a reliable and valid instrument and has been used in multiple studies. Given advances in heart failure (HF) self-care, we proposed to reevaluate the psychometric properties of the AHFKTv2 across these recent studies and update the instrument. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and baseline AHFKTv2 data from 4 intervention studies in persons with HF were combined for this analysis (N = 284). The 30 questions of the AHFKT are focused on 5 HF self-care knowledge domains: pathophysiology, nutrition, behavior, medications, and symptoms. Characteristics of the sample were analyzed using descriptive statistics; validity testing with t tests and Mann-Whitney 2-group tests and Pearson r and Spearman ρ correlations; and reliability calculations and factor analysis were performed based on tetrachoric correlations. RESULTS: Participants were 22 to 84 years of age, 66\% were African American, 63\% were male, and 94\% had New York Heart Association class II to III HF. Mean AHFKT score was 80.6\% (±11\%). Hypotheses that higher levels of knowledge would be associated with higher education level (t = -2.7, P {\textless} .01) and less sodium consumption (ρ = -0.22, P = .03) were validated. Factor analysis revealed 1 general knowledge factor with good reliability, Cronbach's α was .87. Item response analysis identified individual questions requiring review and revision. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive psychometric evaluation of the AHFKTv2 confirmed its internal consistency reliability and validity and provided direction for production of the AHFKTv3 available for use in research and clinical practice.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patient's knowledge about heart failure (HF) contributes to successful HF self-care, but less is known about shared patient-caregiver knowledge. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this analysis was to: 1) identify configurations of shared HF knowledge in patient-caregiver dyads; 2) characterize dyads within each configuration by comparing sociodemographic factors, HF characteristics, and psychosocial factors; and 3) quantify the relationship between configurations and patient self-care adherence to managing dietary sodium and HF medications. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data (N = 114 dyads, 53\% spousal). Patient and caregiver HF knowledge was measured with the Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test. Patient dietary sodium intake was measured by 3-day food record and 24 h urine sodium. Medication adherence was measured by Medication Events Monitoring System caps. Patient HF-related quality of life was measured by the Minnesota Heart Failure Questionnaire; caregiver health-related quality of life was measured by the Short Form-12 Physical Component Summary. Patient and caregiver depression were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Patient and caregiver perceptions of caregiver-provided autonomy support to succeed in heart failure self-care were measured by the Family Care Climate Questionnaire. Multilevel and latent class modeling were used to identify dyadic knowledge configurations. T-tests and chi-square tests were used to characterize differences in sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial characteristics by configuration. Logistic/linear regression were used to quantify relationships between configurations and patient dietary sodium and medication adherence. RESULTS: Two dyadic knowledge configurations were identified: "Knowledgeable Together" (higher dyad knowledge, less incongruence; N = 85, 75\%) and "Knowledge Gap" (lower dyad knowledge, greater incongruence; N = 29, 25\%). Dyads were more likely to be in the "Knowledgeable Together" group if they were White and more highly educated, if the patient had a higher ejection fraction, fewer depressive symptoms, and better autonomy support, and if the caregiver had better quality of life. In unadjusted comparisons, patients in the "Knowledge Gap" group were less likely to adhere to HF medication and diet. In adjusted models, significance was retained for dietary sodium only. CONCLUSIONS: Dyads with higher shared HF knowledge are likely more successful with select self-care adherence behaviors.},
