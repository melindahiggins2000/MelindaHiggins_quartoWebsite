	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Psychoeducation interventions using distance learning modalities to engage caregivers in active learning environments have demonstrated benefits in enhancing caregiving mastery. However, few of these programs have been specifically adapted to develop mastery in Black caregivers. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A multi-method approach was carried out to assess Caregiving While Black (CWB), including pre-post surveys and in-depth interviews. This psychoeducation course addresses the cultural realities of caring for a person living with dementia as a Black American. Caregivers engaged in online asynchronous education related to healthcare navigation, home life management, and self-care. Primary (caregiving mastery) and secondary outcomes (anxiety, depression, perceived stress, burden, perceived ability to manage behavioral \& psychological symptoms) were assessed at baseline and post-course (10 weeks). RESULTS: Thirty-two Black caregivers from across the United States completed the course within the allotted timeframe. Paired sample t-test analyses revealed significant reductions in caregiver burden and role strain. Caregiver mastery from baseline to completion increased by 0.45 points with an effect size of 0.26 (Cohen's d). Twenty-nine caregivers participated in an optional post-course interview, and thematic analysis led to the construction of 5 overarching themes: Comfortability with a Culturally Tailored Course; Experiences Navigating the Course Platform; Utility of Course Resources; Time as a Barrier and Facilitator; Familial and Community Engagement. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Pilot findings convey a need to continue creating and receiving feedback on culturally tailored psychoeducation programs for dementia caregivers. The next steps include applying results to fuel the success of the next iteration of CWB.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Tele-Savvy is a synchronous/asynchronous psychoeducation program for caregivers of community-dwelling persons living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) designed to increase caregivers' competence and confidence (mastery) in caregiving. Its overall efficacy was tested in a randomized controlled trial. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This secondary data analysis examined the caregiver mastery and psychological health (i.e., perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and burden) outcome of 153 non-Hispanic Black American and White caregivers (31 non-Hispanic Black American and 122 White caregivers) from baseline to 6 months postintervention. Given the difference in the sample sizes of Black and White caregivers, a descriptive post hoc subgroup analysis was conducted of 21 non-Hispanic Black American and 20 White adult children and grandchildren caregivers. RESULTS: In the overall sample, Black American caregivers demonstrated higher levels of mastery and lower levels of distress than White caregivers at baseline and across all time points. Over time, White caregivers, but not Black American caregivers, experienced significantly improved levels of mastery and significantly lowered levels of depression. Within the subgroup analysis, except for a moderate effect size in the management of situation scores over time among Black American adult children caregivers, similar results were obtained. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The findings highlight the strengths and shortcomings of the Tele-Savvy program in improving caregiver mastery and reducing negative psychological health outcomes. Intentionally tailoring the Tele-Savvy program to certain racial and caregiving groups may hold promise in meeting the needs of more ADRD caregivers. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03033875.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Existing literature suggests that transgender women (TW) may be at high risk for adverse mental health due to stress attributed to combined experiences of stigma and complex social and structural vulnerabilities. Little research has examined how these co-occurring experiences relate to mental health. We aimed to test a theoretically driven conceptual model of relationships between stigma, social and structural vulnerabilities, and mental health to inform future intervention tailoring. DESIGN/METHODS: Partial least square path modeling followed by response-based unit segmentation was used to identify homogenous clusters in a diverse community sample of United States (US)-based TW (N = 1418; 46.2\% White non-Hispanic). This approach examined associations between latent constructs of stigma (polyvictimization and discrimination), social and structural vulnerabilities (housing and food insecurity, unemployment, sex work, social support, and substance use), and mental health (post-traumatic stress and psychological distress). RESULTS: The final conceptual model defined the structural relationship between the variables of interest within stigma, vulnerability, and mental health. Six clusters were identified within this structural framework which suggests that racism, ethnicism, and geography may be related to mental health inequities among TW. CONCLUSION: Our findings around the impact of racism, ethnicism, and geography reflect the existing literature, which unfortunately shows us that little change has occurred in the last decade for TW of color in the Southern US; however, the strength of our evidence (related to sampling structure and sample size) and type of analyses (accounting for co-occurring predictors of health, i.e., stigma and complex vulnerabilities, reflecting that of real-world patients) is a novel and necessary addition to the literature. Findings suggest that health interventions designed to offset the negative effects of stigma must include anti-racist approaches with components to reduce or eliminate barriers to resources that contribute to social and structural vulnerabilities among TW. Herein we provide detailed recommendations to guide primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention efforts. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study demonstrated the importance of considering stigma and complex social and structural vulnerabilities during clinical care and design of mental health interventions for transgender women who are experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder and psychological distress. Specifically, interventions should take an anti-racist approach and would benefit from incorporating social support-building activities.},
