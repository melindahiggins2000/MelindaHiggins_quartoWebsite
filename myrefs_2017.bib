	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between 6-min walk test distance (6MWD) and 30-day readmission in hospitalized heart failure (HF) patients. BACKGROUND: 6MWD is known to predict hospitalizations in outpatients with HF, but its ability to predict recidivism in hospitalized HF patients is relatively unknown. METHODS: Seventy-one hospitalized HF patients with NYHA Class II/III (mean age 52.6 ± 12.3 years, 42.3\% female, 73.2\% African American) performed 6MWD prior to discharge. Logistic regression was used to determine relationships between 6MWD and 30-day readmission. RESULTS: 30-day readmission occurred in 14 (19.7\%) patients. Average 6MWD was 756.4 ± 403.2 feet. Higher 6MWD significantly decreased risk of 30-day readmission, even after adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics (OR = .84, 95\% CI [.71, .99]). For each additional 100 feet walked, odds of a 30-day readmission decreased by 16\%. CONCLUSIONS: 6MWD predicted 30-day readmission in this study, warranting further investigation to understand how the 6MWD may predict readmissions and guide treatment in hospitalized HF patients.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Co-occurring neurodevelopmental disabilities (including cognitive and language delays and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) affect over half of children with ASD and may affect later behavioral, language, and cognitive outcomes beyond the ASD diagnosis. However, no studies have examined predictors of co-occurring neurodevelopmental disabilities in children with ASD. This study investigated whether maternal sociodemographic, perinatal and neonatal factors are associated with co-occurring disabilities. DESIGN AND METHODS: This study involved a retrospective analysis of medical records for children diagnosed with ASD between 2009 and 2010 at an Autism Center in the southeast United States. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of co-occurring neurodevelopmental disabilities. RESULTS: Of the 385 children in the sample, 61\% had a co-occurring neurodevelopmental disability. Children whose mothers had less education (OR: 0.905), had never been married (OR: 1.803), or had bleeding during pregnancy (OR: 2.233) were more likely to have a co-occurring neurodevelopmental disability. Both preterm birth and African American race were associated with bleeding during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Several maternal and perinatal risk factors for ASD were found to put children at risk for further diagnoses of co-occurring neurodevelopmental disabilities. While prematurity, a well-established risk factor for ASD, as well as maternal ethnicity was not found to increase the risk of a co-occurring disability, this study suggests that bleeding during pregnancy may moderate these relationships. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Understanding maternal, perinatal, and neonatal risk factors may inform healthcare provider screening for ASD and co-occurring neurodevelopmental disabilities by helping providers recognize infants who present with multiple risk factors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Overweight and obesity are sensitive issues to address with pediatric patients during any visit. Patients and families may not recognize that their child is overweight or obese and may not be ready to make change. The goals for this study were to collect overall statistics on the clinic in regards to weight status of children presenting for well child visits and to capture parental perception of the child's weight status in relation to child's age. METHODS: A consecutive sample of parents and caregivers with a child aged 2-18 completed the survey and consented for the study on the day of the survey during a well child visit. CONCLUSIONS: Parents, regardless of culture and age tended to underestimate the weight of their child. These findings further support the literature in that the younger the child, the more likely it is that the parent underestimates their weight status. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Interventions should include early education with parents on what a healthy weight is and how it can predict future health. Addressing and recognizing early concerns and assessing parental perception can be important if educational messages are delivered throughout the span of the early years.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is a common comorbidity of heart failure. Little is known about the influence of heart failure symptomatology and coping resources, such as social support and social problem-solving, on depression. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether individual and clinical characteristics, heart failure symptomatology, and the subcomponents of social support and social problem-solving increase the likelihood of depression in outpatients with heart failure. METHODS: A secondary data analysis of a cross sectional study with 201 outpatients with heart failure was conducted. The following self-report questionnaires were used to collect data: the Heart Failure Symptom Survey, the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List-12, the Graven and Grant Social Network Survey, the Social Problem-Solving Inventory Revised-Short, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression scale. Descriptive statistics examined patient characteristics. Logistic regression explored predictors of depression from among individual and clinical characteristics, heart failure symptomatology, and subcomponents of social support (i.e., belonging, tangible, and appraisal support) and social problem-solving (i.e., positive and negative problem orientation; rational, impulsiveness/carelessness, and avoidance problem-solving styles). RESULTS: The sample was primarily Caucasian (86.1\%) male (62.6\%) with an average age of 72.57 years. Individuals who were unmarried, experienced a higher symptom burden, and those who perceived less belonging support were more likely to be depressed. The subcomponents of social problem-solving did not influence depression. CONCLUSIONS: Belonging support was the most beneficial type of social support related to depression. Components of social problem-solving were not related to depression. Assessment of marital status, heart failure symptomatology, and perceived belonging support is needed to identify potential stressors and available social support in order to promote psychological adaptation.},

Measures included Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine, Atlanta HF Knowledge Test, a heart failure Medication Adherence Scale, and sodium intake (24-hr urine and 3-day food record). Patients with low health literacy (LHL) were more likely to have lower HF knowledge ( p {\textless} .001) and trended to poorer medication adherence ( p = .077) and higher sodium intake ( p = .072). When FMs had LHL, FMs were more likely to have lower HF knowledge ( p = .001) and patients trended toward higher sodium intake ( p = .067). When both patients and FMs had LHL, lowest HF knowledge and poorest medication adherence were observed ( p {\textless} .027). The health literacy of both patient and FM needs to be considered when designing interventions to foster self-care.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether 24\% sucrose solution given orally before insertion of a peripheral intravenous (PIV) catheter decreases neonatal pain. BACKGROUND: Prior studies of pain caused by heel and arterial needlesticks found oral administration of 24\% sucrose to significantly blunt pain during these painful procedures. No studies have evaluated this treatment with needlestick pain associated with PIV catheter insertion. METHODS: Oral 24\% sucrose or placebo solution was administered 2 minutes prior to PIV catheter insertion. Outcome measures were obtained prior to, during, and for 5 minutes after PIV catheter insertion. Investigators and caregivers were blinded to group assignment. Data were analyzed with longitudinal analysis of repeated measures, with P {\textless} .05 for significance. RESULTS: A total of 40 neonates (24\% sucrose: N = 20; placebo: N = 20) were studied. Pain scores significantly increased from 3.2 ± 1.6 to a maximum of 7.6 ± 3.8 at the time of catheter insertion, returning to baseline levels 8 minutes after PIV catheter insertion (P {\textless} .001). No significant differences were found in pain, heart rate, or noninvasive oxygen saturation (SpO2) between the sucrose and placebo groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Results from this study did not find that 24\% sucrose administered prior to PIV catheter insertion altered the infant's pain response. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Since this is the first study to evaluate the pain-blunting effects of 24\% sucrose administration before PIV catheter insertion, replication of this study is needed before widespread application of findings.},

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine self-reported rates of adherence to postoperative use of ASA for VTE prophylaxis. METHODS: This was an exploratory, descriptive study using a convenience sample of 99 participants. Adherence was measured with a 4-question self-reporting tool. RESULTS: Thirty-seven percent were male and 76\% were Caucasian, and median age was 63 years. Ninety-two percent had the dosage correct, 76\% knew how long to take the medication, and 100\% of the sample was still taking the ASA; 40\% had forgotten to take 1 or more doses of the medication. No associations were noted. Overall compliance was 44\%. CONCLUSION: A significant number missed 1 or more doses.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder, and it has been increasingly associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The reasons for this relationship are not completely understood but may involve endothelial dysfunction. In this study, we hypothesized that insomnia symptoms would be associated with reduced endothelial function. METHODS: Working adults (n = 496, 67.5\% female, 78.6\% white, mean age 48.7 [SD, 10.8] years, body mass index 28.2 [SD, 6.7] kg/m, diabetes 5.8\%, hypertension 20.0\%, hyperlipidemia 17.9\%, heart disease 2.6\%) enrolled in the Emory-Georgia Tech Predictive Health Institute study completed baseline demographic, clinical, depression (Beck Depression Inventory II), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder 7), sleep (Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index), and noninvasive endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation [FMD]) measures. Insomnia symptoms were defined as subjective sleep latency of 30 minutes or longer, nighttime or early morning awakenings, and/or sleep medication use occurring 3 times or more per week in the past month. RESULTS: Insomnia symptoms were reported by 39.5\% of participants. Multivariable regression models showed that insomnia symptoms, age, baseline artery diameter, and dyslipidemia were inversely related to FMD. After adjusting for age, baseline artery diameter, and dyslipidemia, participants reporting insomnia symptoms had lower FMD than did participants reporting better sleep (adjusted FMD mean, 6.13\% [SD, 0.28\%] vs 6.83\% [SD, 0.26\%], P = .035). CONCLUSION: In this study, insomnia symptoms were associated with reduced FMD. Research examining the therapeutic benefits of treating insomnia on endothelial function and future cardiovascular risk is warranted.},
