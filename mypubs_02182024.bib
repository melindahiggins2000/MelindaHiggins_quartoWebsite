year = {2024},
abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Psychoeducation interventions using distance learning modalities to engage caregivers in active learning environments have demonstrated benefits in enhancing caregiving mastery. However, few of these programs have been specifically adapted to develop mastery in Black caregivers. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A multi-method approach was carried out to assess Caregiving While Black (CWB), including pre-post surveys and in-depth interviews. This psychoeducation course addresses the cultural realities of caring for a person living with dementia as a Black American. Caregivers engaged in online asynchronous education related to healthcare navigation, home life management, and self-care. Primary (caregiving mastery) and secondary outcomes (anxiety, depression, perceived stress, burden, perceived ability to manage behavioral \& psychological symptoms) were assessed at baseline and post-course (10 weeks). RESULTS: Thirty-two Black caregivers from across the United States completed the course within the allotted timeframe. Paired sample t-test analyses revealed significant reductions in caregiver burden and role strain. Caregiver mastery from baseline to completion increased by 0.45 points with an effect size of 0.26 (Cohen's d). Twenty-nine caregivers participated in an optional post-course interview, and thematic analysis led to the construction of 5 overarching themes: Comfortability with a Culturally Tailored Course; Experiences Navigating the Course Platform; Utility of Course Resources; Time as a Barrier and Facilitator; Familial and Community Engagement. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Pilot findings convey a need to continue creating and receiving feedback on culturally tailored psychoeducation programs for dementia caregivers. The next steps include applying results to fuel the success of the next iteration of CWB.},

year = {2024},
abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Tele-Savvy is a synchronous/asynchronous psychoeducation program for caregivers of community-dwelling persons living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) designed to increase caregivers' competence and confidence (mastery) in caregiving. Its overall efficacy was tested in a randomized controlled trial. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This secondary data analysis examined the caregiver mastery and psychological health (i.e., perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and burden) outcome of 153 non-Hispanic Black American and White caregivers (31 non-Hispanic Black American and 122 White caregivers) from baseline to 6 months postintervention. Given the difference in the sample sizes of Black and White caregivers, a descriptive post hoc subgroup analysis was conducted of 21 non-Hispanic Black American and 20 White adult children and grandchildren caregivers. RESULTS: In the overall sample, Black American caregivers demonstrated higher levels of mastery and lower levels of distress than White caregivers at baseline and across all time points. Over time, White caregivers, but not Black American caregivers, experienced significantly improved levels of mastery and significantly lowered levels of depression. Within the subgroup analysis, except for a moderate effect size in the management of situation scores over time among Black American adult children caregivers, similar results were obtained. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The findings highlight the strengths and shortcomings of the Tele-Savvy program in improving caregiver mastery and reducing negative psychological health outcomes. Intentionally tailoring the Tele-Savvy program to certain racial and caregiving groups may hold promise in meeting the needs of more ADRD caregivers. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03033875.},

volume = {56},
year = {2024},
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Existing literature suggests that transgender women (TW) may be at high risk for adverse mental health due to stress attributed to combined experiences of stigma and complex social and structural vulnerabilities. Little research has examined how these co-occurring experiences relate to mental health. We aimed to test a theoretically driven conceptual model of relationships between stigma, social and structural vulnerabilities, and mental health to inform future intervention tailoring. DESIGN/METHODS: Partial least square path modeling followed by response-based unit segmentation was used to identify homogenous clusters in a diverse community sample of United States (US)-based TW (N = 1418; 46.2\% White non-Hispanic). This approach examined associations between latent constructs of stigma (polyvictimization and discrimination), social and structural vulnerabilities (housing and food insecurity, unemployment, sex work, social support, and substance use), and mental health (post-traumatic stress and psychological distress). RESULTS: The final conceptual model defined the structural relationship between the variables of interest within stigma, vulnerability, and mental health. Six clusters were identified within this structural framework which suggests that racism, ethnicism, and geography may be related to mental health inequities among TW. CONCLUSION: Our findings around the impact of racism, ethnicism, and geography reflect the existing literature, which unfortunately shows us that little change has occurred in the last decade for TW of color in the Southern US; however, the strength of our evidence (related to sampling structure and sample size) and type of analyses (accounting for co-occurring predictors of health, i.e., stigma and complex vulnerabilities, reflecting that of real-world patients) is a novel and necessary addition to the literature. Findings suggest that health interventions designed to offset the negative effects of stigma must include anti-racist approaches with components to reduce or eliminate barriers to resources that contribute to social and structural vulnerabilities among TW. Herein we provide detailed recommendations to guide primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention efforts. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study demonstrated the importance of considering stigma and complex social and structural vulnerabilities during clinical care and design of mental health interventions for transgender women who are experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder and psychological distress. Specifically, interventions should take an anti-racist approach and would benefit from incorporating social support-building activities.},

year = {2023},
abstract = {IMPORTANCE: First-line treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), ie, trauma-focused therapy, while effective, is limited by low treatment initiation, high dropout, and high treatment refraction. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of Trauma Center Trauma-Sensitive Yoga (TCTSY) vs first-line cognitive processing therapy (CPT) in women veterans with PTSD related to military sexual trauma (MST) and the hypothesis that PTSD outcomes would differ between the interventions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multisite randomized clinical trial was conducted from December 1, 2015, to April 30, 2022, within 2 VA health care systems located in the southeast and northwest. Women veterans aged 22 to 71 years with MST-related PTSD were enrolled and randomized to TCTSY or CPT. INTERVENTIONS: The TCTSY intervention (Hatha-style yoga focusing on interoception and empowerment) consisted of 10 weekly, 60-minute group sessions, and the CPT intervention (cognitive-based therapy targeting modification of negative posttraumatic thoughts) consisted of 12 weekly, 90-minute group sessions. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Sociodemographic data were collected via self-report survey. The primary outcome, PTSD symptom severity, was assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Assessments were conducted at baseline, midintervention, 2 weeks post intervention, and 3 months post intervention. RESULTS: Of 200 women veterans who consented to participate, the intent-to-treat sample comprised 131 participants (mean [SD] age, 48.2 [11.2] years), with 72 randomized to TCTSY and 59 randomized to CPT. Treatment was completed by 47 participants (65.3\%) in the TCTSY group and 27 (45.8\%) in the CPT group, a 42.6\% higher treatment completion rate in the TCTSY group (P = .03). Both treatment groups improved over time on the CAPS-5 (mean [SD] scores at baseline: 36.73 [8.79] for TCTSY and 35.52 [7.49] for CPT; mean [SD] scores at 3 months: 24.03 [11.55] for TCTSY and 22.15 [13.56]) and the PCL-5 (mean [SD] scores at baseline: 49.62 [12.19] for TCTSY and 48.69 [13.62] for CPT; mean [SD] scores at 3 months: 36.97 [17.74] for TCTSY and 31.76 [12.47]) (P < .001 for time effects). None of the group effects or group-by-time effects were significant. Equivalence analyses of change scores were not significantly different between the TCTSY and CPT groups, and the two one-sided test intervals fell within the equivalence bounds of plus or minus 10 for CAPS-5 for all follow-up time points. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this comparative effectiveness randomized clinical trial, TCTSY was equivalent to CPT in reducing PTSD symptom severity, with both groups improving significantly. The higher treatment completion rate for TCTSY indicates its higher acceptability as an effective and acceptable PTSD treatment for women veterans with PTSD related to MST that could address current VA PTSD treatment limitations.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little is known about where young adults with chronic illness die in the United States and factors associated with place of death. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine place of death and factors associated with place of death for young adults with chronic illness using the most recent national data. METHODS: Our sample ( N = 405,535) from the National Center for Health Statistics Division of Vital Statistics death certificate data (2003-2018) included young adults (age 18-39 years) who died from chronic conditions common in childhood or young adulthood. Conditions were grouped by underlying pathophysiology (oncological, cardiovascular, neuromuscular, metabolic, hematological/immunological, renal, chromosomal/congenital, gastrointestinal, and respiratory). Place of death was dichotomized into acute care (inpatient, outpatient/emergency room, and dead on arrival) or nonacute care (home, hospice, nursing home/long-term care, other, and unknown). Examined factors were gender, year of death, age, race (White, Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaskan Native), cause of death, and city of residence population (100,000 or greater and under 100,000). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to examine factors related to place of death. RESULTS: Over half of young adults died in acute care settings. Young adults who were Asian/Pacific Islander or Black or who died from a respiratory or renal cause of death were most likely to die in an acute care setting. Rates of acute care death decreased over the studied years. DISCUSSION: Many young adults died in an acute care setting. Race and cause of death were the most influential factors associated with place of death. Young adults with an oncological cause of death were less likely to die in an acute care setting than patients with other underlying causes. This may indicate that specific care needs or preferences at the end of life may differ in certain disease populations and may affect place of death. Previous research has shown similar results in other developmental populations; however, given the complex psychosocial concerns that often arise during young adulthood, further research is needed to describe how the young adult status may specifically affect place of death.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) receiving chemotherapy often experience psychoneurological symptoms (PNS; ie, fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, pain, and cognitive dysfunction) that negatively impact both patients' and their caregivers' health outcomes. Limited information is available on PNS management for CRC patient and caregiver dyads. OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study are to (1) develop a web-based dyadic intervention for patients with CRC receiving chemotherapy and their caregivers (CRCweb) and (2) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of CRCweb among patient-caregiver dyads in a cancer clinic. METHODS: A mixed methods approach will be used. Semistructured interviews among 8 dyads will be conducted to develop CRCweb. A single-group pre- and posttest clinical trial will be used to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of the intervention (CRCweb) among 20 dyads. Study assessments will be conducted before (T1) and after intervention (T2). Content analysis will be performed for semistructured interviews. Descriptive statistics will be calculated separately for patients and caregivers, and pre-post paired t tests will be used to evaluate treatment effects. RESULTS: This study was funded in November 2022. As of April 2023, we have obtained institutional review board approval and completed clinical trial registration and are currently recruiting patient-caregiver dyads in a cancer clinic. The study is expected to be completed in October 2024. CONCLUSIONS: Developing a web-based dyadic intervention holds great promise to reduce the PNS burden in patients with CRC receiving chemotherapy and their caregivers. The findings from this study will advance intervention development and implementation of symptom management and palliative care for patients with cancer and their caregivers.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Racial disparities exist in maternal morbidity and mortality, with most of these events occurring in healthy pregnant people. A known driver of these outcomes is unplanned cesarean birth. Less understood is to what extent maternal presenting race/ethnicity is associated with unplanned cesarean birth in healthy laboring people, and if there are differences by race/ethnicity in intrapartum decision-making prior to cesarean birth. METHODS: This secondary analysis of the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be (nuMoM2b) dataset involved nulliparas with no significant health complications at pregnancy onset who had a trial of labor at ≥ 37 weeks with a singleton, non-anomalous fetus in cephalic presentation (N = 5,095). Logistic regression models were used to examine associations between participant-identified presenting race/ethnicity and unplanned cesarean birth. Participant-identified presenting race/ethnicity was used to capture the influence of racism on participant's healthcare experiences. RESULTS: Unplanned cesarean birth occurred in 19.6\% of labors. Rates were significantly higher among Black- (24.1\%) and Hispanic- (24.7\%) compared to white-presenting participants (17.4\%). In adjusted models, white participants had 0.57 (97.5\% CI [0.45-0.73], p < 0.001) lower odds of unplanned cesarean birth compared to Black-presenting participants, while Hispanic-presenting had similar odds as Black-presenting people. The primary indication for cesarean birth among Black- and Hispanic- compared to white-presenting people was non-reassuring fetal heart rate in the setting of spontaneous labor onset. CONCLUSIONS: Among healthy nulliparas with a trial of labor, white-presenting compared to Black or Hispanic-presenting race/ethnicity was associated with decreased odds of unplanned cesarean birth, even after adjustment for pertinent clinical factors. Future research and interventions should consider how healthcare providers' perception of maternal race/ethnicity may bias care decisions, leading to increased use of surgical birth in low-risk laboring people and racial disparities in birth outcomes.},

abstract = {This study examined the role of male pubertal maturation on physical growth and development of neurocircuits that regulate stress, emotional and cognitive control using a translational nonhuman primate model. We collected longitudinal data from male macaques between pre- and peri-puberty, including measures of physical growth, pubertal maturation (testicular volume, blood testosterone -T- concentrations) and brain structural and resting-state functional MRI scans to examine developmental changes in amygdala (AMY), hippocampus (HIPPO), prefrontal cortex (PFC), as well as functional connectivity (FC) between those regions. Physical growth and pubertal measures increased from pre- to peri-puberty. The indexes of pubertal maturation -testicular size and T- were correlated at peri-puberty, but not at pre-puberty (23 months). Our findings also showed ICV, AMY, HIPPO and total PFC volumetric growth, but with region-specific changes in PFC. Surprisingly, FC in these neural circuits only showed developmental changes from pre- to peri-puberty for HIPPO-orbitofrontal FC. Finally, testicular size was a better predictor of brain structural maturation than T levels -suggesting gonadal hormones-independent mechanisms-, whereas T was a strong predictor of functional connectivity development. We expect that these neural circuits will show more drastic pubertal-dependent maturation, including stronger associations with pubertal measures later, during and after male puberty.},

Symptoms for black adults (B/As) with HF are often influenced by lifestyle factors, which may influence their higher mortality rates; few studies address these factors. Distinguishing the links between key elements with diet, inflammation, and symptoms may bring clarity for new dietary strategies in HF clinical care. The purpose of this integrative review is to examine the existing literature regarding relationships among physiologic pathways in HF along with physical and emotional symptoms in the context of inflammation, dietary intake, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), a biomarker of inflammation, and trimethylamine-N-Oxide (TMAO). Based on available evidence, inflammation may be a key link between physical symptoms, diet, depression, TMAO, and TNF-α in persons with HF and warrants further examination to clarify pathological links to solidify evidence for better guidance with dietary modifications. The literature reviewed in this study demonstrates that more work is needed to examine dietary planning, social support, and differences between men and women in the B/A community. Results of this literature review call attention to the essential, personalized care needs related to symptom monitoring and dietary planning which is expected to decrease symptom burden in the HF population.},

abstract = {Little is known about the impact of early palliative care (EPC) combined with motivational interviewing (MI) for persons living with AIDS (PWA). We compared the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of EPC + MI (n = 61) versus usual care (UC) (n = 60) for patients with AIDS, not on antiretroviral medications, enrolled into the Living Well Project trial. Data on clinic, emergency department, and hospital visits were collected through self-report and billing records. Risk-adjusted average annual health care costs were estimated using a generalized linear model with a gamma log-link function. QALYs were calculated using the SF-12v2. Cost-effectiveness was defined as cost per QALY gained. Estimated intervention costs were \$165 per participant. EPC + MI reduced costs by 33\% (AOR = 0.67; CI 95\%: 0.15, 0.93). QALYs did not differ between groups. Results suggest EPC + MI for PWA is cost-saving and maintains quality of life compared to UC due to reduced hospital and ED costs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is increasing in young adults, and greater understanding of their cardiac risk factors is essential to ensure effective prevention. Given the sex differences in CAD observed in older adults, understanding sex differences in risk factors for this younger group of adults is important. Having insight of cardiac risk factors and sex differences in the young adult population is essential to creating personalized strategies for prevention in nursing care and in this age group. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to determine the differences in CAD risk factors for young adult men and women and examine which factors are related to CAD early in life, ultimately to guide approaches for CAD prevention in primary care. METHODS: In this secondary analysis, 125 017 community-dwelling young adults were evaluated for health behaviors considered as risk factors for CAD. The 2017 Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System database from the Center for Disease Control was utilized. This database contains questions asked of young adults that would help with risk management for chronic diseases like CAD. Young adults in this article were defined as being between 18 and 44 years of age. RESULTS: Men reported more cardiovascular risk factors than women and developed risk factors at an earlier age. Women had greater percentages of obesity and low activity levels. In this population, those with hypertension had the highest odds ratio for developing CAD. CONCLUSIONS: Differences between men and women in CAD risk factors included lifestyle and other chronic conditions. Greater prevention efforts should focus on these differences in young men and women to reduce risk factors and prevent the development of CAD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor sleep quality is highly prevalent in atrial fibrillation (AF) with reported links between worse sleep quality and higher AF severity. Little research has examined whether sleep quality changes after AF ablation despite it being a routinely performed procedure. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate self-reported sleep quality before and after AF ablation and to examine whether sleep quality differs by AF severity or sex. METHODS: This longitudinal pilot study assessed sleep using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at preablation and at 1, 3, and 6 months after ablation. Atrial fibrillation disease severity was assessed by the Canadian Cardiology Society Severity of AF scale. Outcomes were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Spearman ρ correlations, and multilevel longitudinal models. RESULTS: The sample (N = 20) was 55\% female with a mean age of 65 (±7) years. Poor sleep quality (mean Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores > 5) was evident at all time points. Improvement was noted at 3 months (moderate effect size d = 0.49); and negligible further improvement, from 3 to 6 months post ablation. Improvement was seen primarily in male subjects (large effect size d = 0.89 at 3 months), with smaller improvements for female subjects. Although Severity of AF scale scores were not correlated with sleep quality, Severity of AF scale severity scores did significantly improve over time. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AF have poor sleep quality that improves for the first 3 months after AF ablation, with men showing more improvement than women. A more accurate understanding of the sleep challenges after AF ablation could lead to development of more realistic patient education and improve patient self-management.},

url = {https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38111602},
volume = {18},
year = {2023},
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Sleep disturbance is prevalent in caregivers of persons living with dementia (PLwD). Tele-Savvy, a 7-week virtual psychoeducational intervention, enhances caregivers' competence and self-care, and reduces depression. While not explicitly designed to do so, Tele-Savvy can potentially improve caregivers' disturbed sleep. The present study aimed to examine the longitudinal effects of Tele-Savvy on caregivers' sleep quality and insomnia. METHODS: This was a secondary data analysis of a 3-arm randomized control trial [Tele-Savvy (active treatment), Healthy Living (attention control), and usual care (waitlist control)]. Multilevel mixed modeling with intent-to-treat principles tested for group, time, and group-by-time effects. Effect sizes were estimated for all changes from baseline to the initial 6-month post-intervention point. Following completion of the 6-month post-randomization delay, we examined combined outcomes for Tele-Savvy. RESULTS: Participants (n=137; mean age 64.7 years) were predominantly female (68.6\%) and White (68.6\%). We found no initial group-by-time effects for the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). For the combined Tele-Savvy group, there was a statistically significant improvement in ISI scores across time (p=0.050). The combined Tele-Savvy effect size for PSQI was d=0.126 and ISI was d=0.310. DISCUSSION: Tele-Savvy resulted in a significant long-term reduction in insomnia symptoms in this sample of caregivers of PLwD and demonstrated a positive trend for improvement in their sleep quality. Since sleep disturbance is so prevalent among caregivers of PLwD, the inclusion of sleep health education into psychoeducation caregiver interventions may yield even better outcomes for caregivers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prognosis for cervical cancer varies greatly between nations. The disparity in cancer survival rates within nations is largely a result of disparities in public knowledge, the accessibility of cancer services, diagnosis and treatment. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the survival rate and associated factors among cervical cancer patients in East Africa. METHODS: Literature search was carried out using Google scholar, PubMed/Medline, Embase and CINHAL. Covidence, a web-based program, was used to import studies for review process. PRISMA guidelines were followed. A total of 110 abstracts were identified from electronic sources. There were five duplicate articles removed. We looked at 105 papers' abstracts and titles, and we excluded 78 of them because they did not fit our inclusion criteria. We conducted a full-text analysis of the remaining 27 papers, leaving out 14 researches that did not fit our inclusion requirements. For final review, 13 studies were included. Using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) assessment checklist, methodological quality was evaluated. RESULTS: The included articles were cohort studies. They were conducted in Ethiopia, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Sudan, Tanzania and Rwanda. One-year, two-year, three-year, four-year and five-year overall survival rates ranged from 67\% to 92\%, 55\% to 84\%, 44\% to 53\%, 32\% to 47\%, and 26\% to 43\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The pooled one-year, two-year, three-year, four-year and five-year survival rates of cervical cancer patients in East Africa were 84\%, 71\%, 50\%, 39\% and 36\%, respectively. HIV status, late presentation, treatment modalities, older age and presence of comorbidities were the most commonly mentioned prognostic factors for survival.

year = {2022},
abstract = {Early life adversity/stress (ELA/ELS), particularly adverse caregiving experiences such as child maltreatment (MALT), is a main risk factor for psychopathology, including psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, ADHD, and substance abuse. Yet how these alterations unfold during development and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, as it is difficult to prospectively and longitudinally study early developmental phases in humans, and nearly impossible to disentangle postnatal caregiving effects from heritable traits. This study examined the specific effects of "nurture" (maternal care) versus "nature" (heritable, biological maternal factors) on nonhuman primate infant socioemotional, stress neuroendocrine, and physical development. For this we used a translational and naturalistic macaque model of infant maltreatment by the mother with randomized assignment at birth to either mothers with a history of maltreating their infants (MALT group, n = 22) or to competent mothers (Control group, n = 20). Over the first 6 months of life (roughly equivalent to 2 years in humans), we examined the development of the mother-infant relationship, as well as infants' social behavior and emotional reactivity. In parallel, we assessed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function longitudinally, using measures of hair cortisol accumulation, and basal morning plasma cortisol. We identified broad impairments in maternal care exhibited by MALT foster mothers, beyond maltreatment (physical abuse, rejection) events, suggesting that MALT foster mothers provide an overall lower quality of care to their infants compared to Controls. MALT infants exhibited alterations in their initiations and breaks of proximity towards their mothers, as well as heightened emotional reactivity in comparison to Controls. Most striking are the HPA axis findings, with MALT infants showing higher levels of plasma cortisol across the first 6 postnatal months as well as higher hair cortisol accumulation from birth through month 6 (a signature of chronic stress) than Controls. No caregiving effects were detected on physical growth, which ruled out confounding effects of maternal nutrition, metabolism, etc. Taken together, these results suggest that the developmental trajectory of MALT and Control infants is different, marked by heightened levels of emotional reactivity, increased HPA activity and alterations in mother-infant interactions in MALT animals. These findings appear to be due to specific effects of postnatal maternal care, and not to biological/ behavioral traits inherited from the mother, or due to prenatal programming caused by prenatal stress, as the cross-fostering design controlled for these potential factors. However, we also detected a couple of interesting biological effects suggesting heritable transmission of some phenotypes. The prolonged HPA axis activation during the first 6 postnatal months of life is expected to have long-term consequences for brain, physiological, and behavioral development in MALT offspring.},

volume = {18},
year = {2022},
abstract = {Background: The Emory Roybal Center for Dementia Caregiving Mastery (P30AG064200) supports pilot intervention projects designed to enhance informal caregiving mastery and seeks to further their development, following the NIH Stage Model. The Center’s core assertions are that dementia caregiving is heterogeneous in nature and that caregiving role demands are positioned within a variety of intersections involving dementia stage and type, the nature of care tasks, caregiver-care recipient relationships, and/or other social determinants including race/ethnicity, culture, class, and geography. Thus, interventions to develop/enhance caregiving mastery must be designed within the context of these intersections. This presentation demonstrates the resonance of the Center’s central theme and illustrates the wide range of caregiving situations/contexts investigators seek to address. Method: We analyzed the letters of intent (LOI) investigators submitted to the Center In its three years of operation. The LOIs describe context/situation-specific caregiving mastery interventions investigators seek to develop. Result: In three years, the Center received 67 LOIs from investigators in 26 U.S. states. Most (85\%) were from female investigators; the majority were from early-stage (Assistant Professor) investigators (52\%) and investigators from underrepresented groups (54\%). Responses came from 10 different disciplines (including Behavioral Sciences (including Social Work), 14; Nursing, 12; and Medicine, 10). Proposed interventions fell into three broad (sometimes intersecting) categories: specific caregiving populations (e.g., racial/ethnic groups; specific caregiving relationships); specific caregiving challenges (e.g., skilled care tasks, managing delirium or chronic pain, caregiver self-care); and dementia types (e.g., MCI, Lewy Body Disease (LBD), and Frontotemporal Dementia). To date, the Center has provided support for pilot projects aiming to enhance mastery in caregivers of persons with Primary Progressive Aphasia and with LBD and couples living with MCI, among Native American caregivers and those from the LGBTQ community and rural caregivers, and those faced with skilled care tasks and who needed to develop skills through distance means. Conclusion: The Center has supported pilot projects that illustrate the importance of appreciating the heterogeneity of dementia caregiving. The voluminous response to the LOI call demonstrates the salience of the heterogeneity theme and underscores the need for additional work to enhance dementia caregiving mastery in its many contexts.},

volume = {11},
year = {2022},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To introduce the Community Resiliency Model (CRM) as mental well-being support for healthcare workers working through the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial with a no treatment control group. SETTING: Two large urban health systems in the Southern United States between October 2020 and June 2021. PARTICIPANTS: Eligible participants were currently employed as healthcare workers within the participating healthcare systems. 275 employees registered and consented electronically in response to email invitations. 253 participants completed the baseline survey necessary to be randomised and included in analyses. INTERVENTION: Participants were assigned 1:1 to the control or intervention group at the time of registration. Intervention participants were then invited to 1-hour virtual CRM class teaching skills to increase somatic awareness in the context of self and other care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported data were collected rating somatic awareness, well-being, symptoms of stress, work engagement and interprofessional teamwork. RESULTS: Baseline data on the total sample of 275 (53\% nurses) revealed higher symptoms of stress and lower well-being than the general population. The intervention participants who attended a CRM class (56) provided follow-up survey data at 1 week (44) and 3 months (36). Significant improvement for the intervention group at 3 months was reported for the well-being measures (WHO-5, p<0.0087, d=0.66; Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, p<0.0004, d=0.66), teamwork measure (p≤0.0002, d=0.41) and stress (Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale, p=0.0058, d=46). CONCLUSION: Baseline results indicate mental health is a concern for healthcare workers. Post intervention findings suggest that CRM is a practical approach to support well-being for healthcare workers during a crisis such as this pandemic. The simple tools that comprise the model can serve as a starting point for or complement self-care strategies to enhance individual resilience and buffer the effects of working in an increasingly stressful work environment.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to explore the preliminary efficacy of trauma-sensitive yoga compared to cognitive processing therapy (CPT) for women Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to military sexual trauma (MST) in a pilot randomized control trial (RCT). We then compared these results to published interim results for the subsequent full-scale RCT. METHOD: The analytic sample included women Veterans (N = 41) with PTSD related to MST accessing healthcare in a southeastern Veterans Affairs Health Care System. The majority were African American, non-Hispanic (80.5 \%). The protocol-driven group interventions, Trauma Center Trauma-Sensitive Yoga (TCTSY; n = 17) and the evidence-based control condition, CPT (n = 24), were delivered weekly for 10 and 12 sessions, respectively. Multilevel linear models (MLM) were used to compare changes over time between the two groups. RESULTS: The primary outcomes presented here are PTSD symptom severity and diagnosis, assessed using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the PTSD Symptom Checklist (PCL) total scores. PTSD symptom severity on both clinician-administered (CAPS) and self-reported (PCL) measures, improved significantly (p < .005) over time, with large within group effect sizes (0.90-0.99) consistent with the subsequent RCT. Participants in the TCTSY group showed clinically meaningful improvements earlier than the CPT group participants from baseline on the CAPS and PCL Total scores. CONCLUSIONS: Results support published findings of the effectiveness of TCTSY in the treatment for PTSD related to MST among women Veterans, particularly African American women. TCTSY warrants consideration as an adjunctive, precursor, or concurrent treatment to evidence-based psychotherapies. Future research should include patient preference, men with sexual trauma, and civilian populations.},

abstract = {IMPACT: The success of any clinical research team is dependent on hiring individuals with the experience and skill set needed for a specific research project. Strategies to improve the ability of human resource (HR) recruiters to screen and advance qualified candidates for a project will result in improved initiation and execution of the project. OBJECTIVE/GOALS: HR recruiters play a critical role in matching research applicants to the posted job descriptions and presenting a list of top candidates to the PI/hiring manager for interview and hiring consideration. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Creating guidelines to screen for applicant qualification based on resumes when clinical research positions have multiple levels of expertise required is a complex process of discovery, moving from subjective rationale for rating individual resumes to a more structured less biased evaluation process. To improve the hiring process of the research workforce, we successfully developed guidelines for categorizing research coordinator applications by level from beginner to advanced. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Through guideline development, we provide a framework to reduce bias and improve the matching of applicant resumes to job levels for improved selection of top candidates to advance for interviewing. Improved applicant to job matching offers an advantage to reduce hiring time, anticipate training needs, and shorten the timeline to active project engagement. These guidelines can form the basis for initial screening and ultimately matching individual qualities to project-specific needs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although radiation therapy (RT) has been recognized for contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD), it is unknown whether specific doses received by cardiovascular tissues influence development. OBJECTIVE: In this pilot study, we examined the contribution of RT dose distribution on the development of CVD events in patients with cancer within 5 years of RT. METHODS: A retrospective case-controlled design was used matching 28 cases receiving thoracic RT who subsequently developed an adverse CVD event with 28 controls based upon age, gender, and cancer type. Dose volume histograms of nongated computed tomography scans received during RT characterized the dose delivered to the heart. Heart chambers were segmented using an atlas approach, and radiomics features for the segmentation as well as planning dose in each chamber were tabulated for analysis. RESULT: No significant differences were observed in the RT dose statistics between groups, preexisting CVD, nor significant differences of RT doses delivered to distinct chambers of the heart. Cases were found to have greater CVD risk factors at the time of cancer diagnosis. Morphological significant differences for perimeter on border ( P = .043), equivalent spherical radius ( P = .050), and elongation ( P = .038) were observed, with preexisting CVD having the highest values (ie, larger hearts). CONCLUSION: Traditional CVD risk factors were more prevalent in the cases who developed CVD. No differences were observed in doses of RT. Of note, we observed significant differences in heart morphology and mass in known diseased hearts on the pretreatment scans. These new metrics may have implications for the measurement and quantification of CVD.},

Yoga has shown promise in research examining its benefit for symptoms and sequela of PTSD. AIMS: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Trauma Center Trauma-Sensitive Yoga (TCTSY) for women veterans with PTSD related to MST. METHOD: In this feasibility study, the final sample included women veterans (n = 41) with PTSD related to MST accessing health care in a Veterans Affairs Health Care System in the southeast United States; the majority were African American (n = 33; 80.5\%). Interventions used established protocols of 10 weekly sessions of group TCTSY versus 12 weekly sessions of group Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT). PTSD was assessed via clinical interview and participant report. Additional data collection included multiple participant-reported outcomes commonly associated with PTSD and psychophysiological measures. We also collected data regarding participant satisfaction and feasibility-related feedback from participants and providers. RESULTS: Feasibility and acceptability were evaluated via demand, practicality, fidelity, and acceptability. This was measured by expressed interest, attendance, program completion, barriers to care and satisfaction with treatment, and satisfaction with interventions and data collection. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate the RCT design and TCTSY implementation were feasible; a full-scale RCT was subsequently conducted to determine efficacy of the experimental intervention. Recommendations for successful research strategies are provided.},

The Tele-Savvy Caregiver program for informal caregivers of persons living with dementia was tested in a randomized controlled trial with an attention control condition. The purpose of this trial was to test Tele-Savvy's efficacy in reducing the negative effects of caregiving on caregivers, promoting quality of life for persons living with dementia, and improving caregiver mastery. We describe the design and implementation of and examine the outcomes associated with the attention control condition. Caregivers were randomized to the immediate Tele-Savvy (active condition), Healthy Living (attention control), or waitlist. The attention control content was focused on healthy lifestyle and was not intended to affect the outcomes that Tele-Savvy targeted. The attention control group was similar to Tele-Savvy in the intervention structure and duration: it consisted of seven weekly group videoconferences and 36 video lessons. Data on outcomes of caregivers and persons living with dementia were collected at baseline and 3 and 6 months postbaseline. Multilevel mixed effects models were used to determine changes in the outcomes. One hundred and eleven caregivers were randomized to the attention control condition (attrition 21.6\%). Eighteen formative assessment interviews focusing on caregivers' experience in the attention control condition were conducted. The attention control condition completers had no statistically significant changes in the variables that Tele-Savvy targeted. These results may be used in the design and implementation of attention control conditions in behavioral intervention research.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A three-armed, waitlist, randomized trial design tested Tele-Savvy, an online adaptation of a successful in-person psychoeducation program, the Savvy Caregiver. Tele-Savvy is delivered over 43 days to groups of 6-8 caregivers in 7 weekly synchronous sessions accompanied by 36 brief asynchronous video lessons. We enrolled 23 cohorts of 15 eligible caregivers (N = 261), randomized 2:2:1 to active, attention control, and usual care arms. We assessed caregiver psychological well-being and caregiving mastery at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Multilevel linear models assessed outcomes over the 3 time points examined. The trial was slightly truncated, with Data and Safety Monitoring Board approval, because of the apparent confounding psychological effects of coronavirus disease 2019 restrictions. RESULTS: Study findings indicate statistically and clinically significant benefits to Tele-Savvy arm caregivers (with moderate to large effect sizes) in the areas of depression, perceived stress, reaction to care recipients' behaviors, and enhancement of caregiver mastery. Expected benefits for caregiver burden and anxiety were not found. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Findings attest to program efficacy and the viability of employing distance means to improve family caregivers' emotional well-being and sense of mastery in the caregiving role over a 6-month period. Next steps entail finding alternate ways to deliver the program to those with connectivity and/or time constraint problems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The population of persons living with dementia (PLWDs) is increasing, although mainstream dementia care quality is suboptimal. PURPOSE: To identify characteristics associated with: (1) PLWDs' neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life; and (2) distress from neuropsychiatric symptoms and well-being among their family caregivers (N = 49). METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional single-group examination of PLWD and caregivers when they enrolled into a nurse-led dementia-centered primary care clinic. Pearson correlations were run between characteristics of PLWD and caregiver and variables representing PLWD's neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life and their caregivers' well-being. Statistically significant correlations were reported via Cohen d statistics. RESULTS: Caregivers' characteristics associated with higher distress from neuropsychiatric symptoms and diminished well-being included Black race, female gender, younger age, caring for a parent with dementia, and being employed. Characteristics of PLWD associated with caregivers' higher distress and diminished well-being included longer time since dementia onset, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, and non-Alzheimer dementia. Caregivers' characteristics associated with higher neuropsychiatric symptom burden included Black race, female gender, younger age, caring for parent PLWD, and being employed. Characteristics of PLWDs associated with higher neuropsychiatric symptom burden included non-Alzheimer dementia, longer time since dementia onset, more comorbidities, and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index. Finally, a longer time since dementia onset was associated with PLWDs' lower quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Black race, caring for caring for a parent with dementia, younger age, and being employed were characteristics linked to PLWDs' higher neuropsychiatric symptom burden and caregivers' diminished well-being. IMPLICATIONS: Clinicians must assess and intervene with unpaid caregivers who may not appear obviously distressed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk appraisal is essential for hypertensive patients to identify correctly their risk status and take efficient behavioral measures timely to avoid major adverse outcomes. However, hypertensive patients' risk perceptions of CVD events in Ethiopia are unknown. Thus, the study aimed to compare the subjective CVD risk perception level of patients with the nonlaboratory Framingham Risk Score (nl-FRS). METHODS: A cross-sectional design was used. The Attitudes and Beliefs about Cardiovascular Disease Risk Questionnaire and the nl-FRS were used to compare subjective versus objective measures of CVD risk. Agreement between participants' risk perceptions and the nl-FRS were examined using the kappa statistic. Bivariate chi-square test and multinomial logistic regression analyses were run to identify factors associated with risk perceptions. The statistical significance was set at a p-value < 0.05 level. RESULTS: Participants (n=377) had a mean age of 53.61 ± 12.80-years, range (18-82 years), 51.2\% were males, 42.7\% had less than high school education, 45.1\% achieved target BP control, and mean HTN duration was 8.01 ± 6.07 years. The majority (58.62\%) of the participants had a low subjective risk perception of CVD events (mean 17.79, 95\% CI: 17.43-18.15). Approximately three-fourths (72.4\%) had a moderate nl-FRS risk calculation (mean, 13.84, 95\% CI: 13.36-14.33). Agreement between participants perceived-risk and the nl-FRS was poor (kappa = 0.0002, standard error = 0.023, p =0.99). Participants' CVD risk-perception inaccuracy was also high (76\%) primarily due to underestimation. Hypertension duration, frequency of physician visits, and level of diabetes control were significant predictors of CVD risk underestimation. CONCLUSION: Hypertensive patients had inaccurate and low subjective risk perceptions of CVD events compared to moderate objective risks identified using the nl-FRS. Planned education on HTN and CVD risk factors is essential to improve patients' CVD risk perception to reduce adverse CVD events.},

The objectives are to (1) demonstrate the feasibility of curating a synthetic control group for an existing study cohort through EHR data extraction and (2) evaluate the effect of a lifestyle intervention on selected cardiovascular health metrics. A total of 711 university employees were recruited between 2008 and 2012 to participate in a health partner intervention to improve cardiovascular health and were followed for five years. Data of nearly 8000 eligible subjects were extracted from the EHR to create a synthetic control cohort during the same study period. To minimize confounding, crude comparison, exact matching, propensity score matching, and doubly robust estimation were used to compare the selected cardiovascular health metrics at 1 and 5 years of follow-up. Blood pressure and body mass index improved in the intervention group compared to the EHR synthetic controls. The findings of changes in lipid measurements were somewhat unexpected. When analyzing the subgroup without lipid-lowering medications, the intervention group exhibited better control of cholesterol levels over time than did our synthetic controls. Some measurements in the EHR system may be more robust for synthetic selection than others. EHR synthetic controls can provide an alternative to estimate intervention effects appropriately in single-arm studies for these measurements.},

abstract = {Aims: One third of the U.S. adult population is estimated to have obesity-associated prediabetes. Hispanics have a 50\% higher type 2 diabetes death rate compared to non-Hispanic whites, yet low participation in lifestyle change programs, making this subgroup an important target for prevention. Our objective was to determine the feasibility and the effects of an intervention implementing the Center for Disease Control and Prevention National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) plus recreational soccer (RS) in Hispanic men. Methods: Overweight and obese Hispanic men, aged 30-57 years with prediabetes at screening were recruited (n = 41). Trained soccer coaches led 30-min facilitated discussion of the NDPP modules after each RS session, with two sessions per week for 12 weeks and once per week for the following 12 weeks. The 1-h RS sessions followed the Football Fitness curriculum. Assessments included body mass index, waist circumference, bioelectrical impedance analysis (InBody 270), blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and validated physical fitness tests. Multilevel mixed models assessed the outcomes as a function of time and cohort and incorporated an unstructured covariance structure to examine the changes from baseline to 24 weeks. All analyses were conducted as intent-to-treat using SAS v 9.4. Results: Hispanic males (n = 41; mean age 41.7 [0.1] years) were obese at baseline (mean BMI 32.7, standard error of mean [0.7], mean weight 93.9 [2.2] kg). Attendance rate was 65\% overall at 12 weeks but differed between cohorts. Five mild injuries occurred over the trial. After 24 weeks of the NDPP+RS intervention, there were significant decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (\%change -4.7[SE 2.4]; 95\% CI [-11.5, -1.7] and -6.1 [1.7] mmHg; [-9.6, -2.6], respectively), HbA1c (-0.2 [0.1]; [-0.3, -0.1]), Despite significant reductions in weight (-3.8 [0.7]; [-5.2, -2.5]), waist circumference (-6.6 [0.7] cm; [-8.0, -5.1]), body fat \% (-1.9 [0.5]; [-2.8, -1.0]), lean body mass was preserved (-0.9 [0.3]; [-1.6, -0.2]). Conclusion: A 24-week soccer-based adaptation of the Diabetes Prevention Program is safe and feasible among middle-aged Latino men.},

abstract = {Greater family caregiver exposure to uncontrolled patient symptoms is predictive of greater caregiver psychological and physiological stress in dementia and other chronic illnesses, but these phenomena have not been well-studied in heart failure (HF) - a disease with high symptom burden. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that worse patient functional status (as reflected by increasing HF symptoms) would be associated with elevated psychological and physiological stress for the caregiver. This was a secondary analysis of data from 125 HF caregivers in the Caregiver Opportunities for Optimizing Lifestyle (COOL) study. Psychological stress was measured on four dimensions: care-related strain/burden (Oberst Caregiving Burden Scale), depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Index), and general stress (Perceived Stress Scale). Physiological stress was measured by markers of HPA axis function (elevated cortisol awakening response [CAR]), endothelial dysfunction (increased PAI-1), and inflammation (increased IL-6, hsCRP). HF patient functional status was quantified by caregiver assessment of New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class. Generalized linear models were used to test associations between patient NYHA Class and stress (one model per indicator). NYHA Class (ordinal) was backwards difference coded in each model to examine caregiver stress in relation to increasing levels of HF severity. Caregivers were mostly female and in their mid-fifties, with a slight majority of the sample being African American and the patient's spouse. Overall, patient functional status was associated with greater caregiver psychological and physiological stress. In terms of psychological stress, higher NYHA Class was significantly associated with greater caregiver anxiety and general stress, but not with caregiver burden or depression. In terms of physiological stress, higher NYHA Class was associated with elevated markers in all models (elevated CAR and higher IL-6, hsCRP, and PAI-1). Across models, most associations between NYHA Class and stress were present at relatively early stages of functional limitation (i.e. Class II), while others emerged when functional limitations became more severe. To inform timing and mechanisms for much-needed caregiver interventions, research is needed to determine which aspects of HF symptomatology are most stressful for caregivers across the HF trajectory.},

PURPOSE: The purpose is of this project was to evaluate the implementation of an integrated mental health and acute care clinical model on a dedicated education unit (DEU). METHODS: In this pilot project, students provided dually focused medical and mental health care on assigned patients. A preclass and postclass survey measured their perceptions of mental health competency. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups (integrated model on the DEU compared with a traditional experience on an acute care and inpatient behavioral health unit). All groups reported increased mental health competency. CONCLUSIONS: Both groups showed similar improvements from the preclass to the postclass survey on perceived competence, suggesting that an integrated acute care and mental health clinical practicum may be equivalent to the traditional model.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Front-line workers (FLW) are at risk for secondary traumatic stress, burnout, and related psychiatric sequelae: depression, anxiety, suicidality, posttraumatic stress disorder, and sleep and substance use disorders. FLW are in need of self-care programs to support their mental health. METHODS: Quasi-experimental study to assess the impact of a simple mental well-being and emotional regulation training, the Community Resiliency Model (CRM), using a convenience sample of FLW. Baseline scores of mental well-being and stress measures were compared with follow-up scores at 3 time points. Outcomes were psychological wellness (World Health Organization-5 Well-being Index); resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10); traumatic stress (Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale); physical symptoms (Somatic Symptom Scale-8). RESULTS: Of the 104 participants who enrolled and attended the CRM training, 73 (70.2\%) completed at least 1 posttest. Well-being scores increased at 1 year with a small-moderate effect size (Cohen d=0.32). Resilience scores increased with a small-moderate effect size by 1 year (Cohen d=0.36). Secondary traumatic stress scores declined, with the largest effect at 1 week (Cohen d=0.49). Somatic symptoms decreased at each posttest, with the largest change occurring from baseline to 1 week (d=0.39). Participants reported an awareness of body sensations helped them when overwhelmed as a means of calming themselves. CONCLUSIONS: After a 3-hour CRM training, participants reported improved mental well-being and decreased secondary traumatic stress and somatic symptoms. This simple body awareness intervention may be a good resource during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Because OR teams are transient and hierarchical, social order is continuously being negotiated around this partition. We hypothesized that drape transparency, a tool for reimagining the physical and symbolic confines of the OR, might alter behavior. Due to the proximity of anesthesia providers to the drape, we examined how the drape’s transparency affected “social” and “case-related” communication between them and clinicians from surgery and nursing. We observed 58 surgical cases using an OR ethogram to document interprofessional communications (344 exchanges) involving the anesthesia provider. The effect of the type drape showed a statistically significant, GzMLM F(1, 342) = 4.924, p =.027, increase only for “social” communication. The frequency of “social” communication, known to enhance collegiality, was greater when a transparent drape was substituted for the opaque drape (34.9\% vs. 21.3\%, respectively).},

abstract = {Objective: To conduct an interim analysis of data collected from an ongoing multisite randomized clinical trial (RCT) assessing the effectiveness of Trauma Center Trauma-Sensitive Yoga (TCTSY) for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among women veterans with PTSD related to military sexual trauma (MST). The purpose of the interim analysis was to assess outcomes from the primary site, which is geographically, demographically, culturally, and procedurally distinct from the second site. Design: RCT was conducted within a Veterans Administration Health Care System. Data collection included preintervention through 3 months postintervention. Participants: Enrollment for the main site was 152 women. The sample size for the intent-to-treat analysis was 104. The majority were African American (91.3\%) with a mean age of 48.46 years. Intervention: The TCTSY intervention (n = 58) was conducted by TCTSY-certified yoga facilitators and consisted of 10 weekly 60-min group sessions. The control intervention, cognitive processing therapy (CPT; n = 46), consisted of 12 90-min weekly group sessions conducted per Veterans Administration protocol by clinicians in the PTSD Clinic. Outcome measures: The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) was used to assess current PTSD diagnosis and symptom severity, including overall PTSD and four symptom clusters. The PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) was used to obtain self-report of PTSD symptom severity, including total score and four symptom clusters. Results: The findings reported here are interim results from one clinical site. For both the CAPS-5 and PCL-5, total scores and all four criterion scores decreased significantly (p < 0.01) over time in all five multilevel linear models within both TCTSY and CPT groups, without significant differences between groups. There were clinically meaningful improvements seen for both TCTSY and CPT with 51.1\%-64.3\% of TCTSY subjects and 43.5\%-73.7\% of CPT decreasing their CAPS-5 scores by 10 points or more. Effect sizes for total symptom severity were large for TCTSY (Cohen's d = 1.10-1.18) and CPT (Cohen's d = 0.90-1.40). Intervention completion was higher in TCTSY (60.3\%) than in CPT (34.8\%). Symptom improvement occurred earlier for TCTSY (midintervention) than for CPT (2 weeks postintervention). Safety: There were no unanticipated adverse events in this study. Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that TCTSY may be an effective treatment for PTSD that yields symptom improvement more quickly, has higher retention than CPT, and has a sustained effect. TCTSY may be an effective alternative to trauma-focused therapy for women veterans with PTSD related to MST. The study is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (CTR no.: NCT02640690).},

url = {https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34653033},
volume = {46},
year = {2021},
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Historically, stillbirth risk factors are more prevalent among non-Hispanic Black women than non-Hispanic White women, including age < 20, lower formal educational attainment, prepregnancy obesity, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, short interpregnancy interval, small for gestational age newborn, late prenatal care, and previous cesarean birth. We examined whether these disparities have changed since 2011 and identified a group of risk factors that differed between Black women and White women when accounting for correlations among variables. METHODS: In a random sample of 315 stillbirths from the National Center for Health Statistics' 2016 fetal death data, Black women and White women were compared for each risk factor using t-tests or chi-square tests. Variables with p ≤ .20 were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance. RESULTS: In this sample, Black women experiencing stillbirth were less likely to have a Bachelor's degree (12.94\% vs. 28.49\%, p = .04), and more likely to be obese (44.5\% vs. 29.1\%, p = .01) than White women. Multivariate analysis accounting for correlations among variables showed a group of risk factors that differed between Black women and White women: age < 20, lower education, prepregnancy obesity, hypertension (chronic and pregnancy-associated), nulliparity before stillbirth, and earlier gestation. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Less formal education, obesity, age <20, hypertension, chronic and pregnancy-associated, nulliparity, and earlier gestation are important to consider in multilevel stillbirth prevention interventions to decrease racial disparity in stillbirth. Respectfully listening to women and taking their concerns seriously is one way nurses and other health care providers can promote equity in health outcomes for childbearing women.},

year = {2021},
abstract = {Refugee women face numerous and unique barriers to sexual and reproductive healthcare and can experience worse pregnancy-related outcomes compared with U.S.-born and other immigrant women. Community-based, culturally tailored programs like Embrace Refugee Birth Support may improve refugee access to healthcare and health outcomes, but empirical study is needed to evaluate programmatic benefits. This community-engaged research study is led by the Georgia Doula Access Working Group, including a partnership between academic researchers, Emory Decatur Hospital nurses, and Embrace. We analyzed hospital clinical records (N = 9,136) from 2016 to 2018 to assess pregnancy-related outcomes of Embrace participants (n = 113) and a comparison group of women from the same community and racial/ethnic backgrounds (n = 9,023). We controlled for race, language, maternal age, parity, insurance status, preeclampsia, and diabetes. Embrace participation was significantly associated with 48\% lower odds of labor induction (OR = 0.52, p = 0.025) and 65\% higher odds of exclusive breastfeeding intentions (OR = 1.65, p = 0.028). Embrace showed positive but non-significant trends for reduced cesarean delivery (OR = 0.83, p = 0.411), higher full-term gestational age (OR = 1.49, p = 0.329), and reduced low birthweight (OR = 0.77, p = 0.55). We conclude that community-based, culturally tailored pregnancy support programs like Embrace can meet the complex needs of refugee women. Additionally, community-engaged, cross-sector research approaches could ensure the inclusion of both community and clinical perspectives in research design, implementation, and dissemination.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sudden cardiac arrest is a major cause of death worldwide. Performance of prompt, high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation improves patient outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between patient survival of in-hospital cardiac arrest and 2 independent variables: adherence to resuscitation guidelines and patient severity of illness, as indicated by the number of organ supportive therapies in use before cardiac arrest. METHODS: An observational study was conducted using prospectively collected data from a convenience sample. Cardiopulmonary arrest forms and medical records were evaluated at an academic medical center. Adherence to resuscitation guidelines was measured with the ZOLL R Series monitor/defibrillator using RescueNet Code Review software. The primary outcome was patient survival. RESULTS: Of 200 cases, 37\% of compressions were in the recommended range for rate (100-120/min) and 63.9\% were in range for depth. The average rate was above target 55.7\% of the time. The average depth was above and below target 1.4\% and 34.7\% of the time, respectively. Of the 200 patients, 125 (62.5\%) attained return of spontaneous circulation. Of those, 94 (47\%) were alive 24 hours after resuscitation. Fifty patients (25\%) were discharged from the intensive care unit alive and 47 (23.5\%) were discharged from the hospital alive. CONCLUSIONS: These exploratory data reveal overall survival rates similar to those found in previous studies. The number of pauses greater than 10 seconds during resuscitation was the one consistent factor that impacted survival. Despite availability of an audiovisual feedback system, rescuers continue to perform compressions that are not at optimal rate and depth.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor adherence to hypertensive medication has been suggested to be a major contributor to uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) in African Americans. The impact that social determinants have on the various patient-level factors, including HTN beliefs, mental well-being, and social support, may provide insight into the development and tailoring of culturally targeted interventions, thus improving adherence. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the relationships of exposures to contextualized racial and gendered stressors, social support, and depressive symptoms with HTN illness perceptions and blood pressure (BP) medication adherence. METHODS: Participants (N = 85) were hypertensive African-American women aged 18 to 45 years (mean [SD], 39.2 [5.4] years) recruited from the community setting and outpatient medical clinics in a large metropolitan city. Hypertension illness beliefs were assessed using the 8-item Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire ("How much does your blood pressure affect your life?") and medication adherence was assessed with the 7-item Adherence to Refills and Medication Scale ("How often do you forget to take your BP medicine?"). Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the associations with medication adherence and linear regression analyses were performed to examine the associations of continuous variables and HTN illness perceptions. RESULTS: The sample was predominantly nonadherent (81.2\%). In the adjusted multivariable regression model, systolic BP (odds ratio, 0.95; P = .05) and the "Consequence" dimension of HTN beliefs (odds ratio, 0.76; P = .02) were associated with medication adherence. In the adjusted linear regression model, systolic BP (β = 0.22, P < .01) and depressive symptoms (β = 1.11, P < .01) were associated with HTN illness beliefs. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing beliefs and the mental well-being before initiating BP medications is essential for adherence and BP control.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: One third of the U.S. adult population is estimated to have prediabetes. Hispanics have a 50\% higher type 2 diabetes (T2DM) death rate compared to non-Hispanic whites, yet low participation in lifestyle change programs, making this subgroup an important target for prevention efforts. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of an exercise intervention implementing the Center for Disease Control and Prevention National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) plus recreational soccer (RS) in Hispanic men. METHODS: Overweight and obese Hispanic men, aged 30-57 years with prediabetes at screening were recruited from the community. Trained soccer coaches led 30-min facilitated discussion of the NDPP modules after each RS session, with two weekly sessions delivered over 12 wks, then once a wk until 24 wks. The 1-h RS sessions followed the Football Fitness curriculum structure. Standardized study assessments included objectively measured physical activity via fitness tracker, physical fitness via validated field tests, global positional system soccer specific metrics and behavior change questionnaires. Mixed models assessed the outcomes as a function of time and cohort and incorporated an unstructured covariance structure to examine the difference between baseline, 12 and 24 wks. All analyses were conducted as intent-to-treat and generated using SAS v 9.4. RESULTS: Hispanic males (n = 41; mean age 41.9 [6.2 SD] years) were obese at baseline (mean BMI 32.7, standard error [0.7]). After 24 wks of the NDPP+RS intervention, there were significant beneficial changes in vertical jump (2.8 [1.3] cm; p = 0.048), agility and lower extremity muscular power (figure 8-run) at 12 wks (-4.7\% change; p = 0.001) and 24 wks (-7.2\% change; p < 0.0001), predicted VO2 max (12 wks: 1.9\%; p = 0.007; 24 wks 1.0\%; p = 0.036), modified push-ups increased 22\% (p < 0.0001) at 12 wks and 31\% (p < 0.0001) at 24 wks, dynamic sit-ups increased 10\% (p = 0.005) at 12 wks and 15\% (p < 0.0001) at 24 wks. CONCLUSION: Among middle-aged Latino men, broad-ranging significant improvements in physical fitness were observed after 24 wks participating in lifestyle education plus RS in a single arm feasibility trial.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many patients are discharged with aspirin (ASA) as an anticoagulant after joint replacement surgery. In studies in which ASA was prescribed, doses were frequently missed. Adherence to postoperative ASA regimen is critical to preventing thrombotic complications. This randomized controlled study evaluated the impact of an existing medication adherence smartphone application (app) on adherence to twice daily ASA 81 mg for 35 days after knee or hip arthroplasty. METHODOLOGY: Patients were randomized to either the app (intervention) group or the usual care (control) group. All patients received a baseline interview with a survey and demographics collected prior to randomization, a 36-day follow-up call for phone pill count, and a 6-week in-office interview with surveys and an in-person pill count. A convenience sample of 195 patients enrolled; 122 completed pill counts at both baseline and end of study. Ages ranged from 29 to 89 (mean: 60.4, SD: 10.1) years. The majority had a bachelor's degree or higher (59.3\%), made more than \$75,000 (or were retired; 51.9\%), were of White race (75.9\%), and female (53.8\%). There were no significant demographic differences between the groups. RESULTS: There were no significant group differences in final pill counts, adherence (reasons for missed pills), or ASA Medication self-efficacy scores. However, the intervention group scored significantly higher on the ASA Adherence measure (general ease in and ability to take ASA; p = .020). Higher ASA Adherence scores were associated with lower pill counts at the end of study (better adherence) in the intervention group. There was a high rate of attrition related to failure to bring the ASA to hospital or to the follow-up appointment. CONCLUSIONS: Although there were no significant differences in final pill counts between groups, the app group reported more ease in taking pills. With smartphone use virtually ubiquitous, this project provided an opportunity to educate patients and nurses about how technology can support medication adherence. It was also an excellent opportunity to involve clinical nurses in a funded research project.},

The goal of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the Great Village on depressive symptoms, anxiety, burden, and mastery in African American caregivers (N = 142). A three-arm randomized control trial (Great Village, Great Village + exercise, and attention control) was conducted over a period of 6 months. Caregivers who received either Great Village or Great Village + exercise reported significant reduction in depressive symptoms and improvement in mastery. Caregivers who received only Great Village reported a reduction in anxiety. Receiving no intervention worsened caregiver burden. African American caregivers should receive culturally tailored interventions to support their health and well-being and improve their competence in caregiving.},

volume = {16},
year = {2020},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a common cause of hospitalization in Medicare. Optimal medication adherence lowers hospitalization risk in HF patients. Although out-of-pocket spending can adversely affect adherence to HF medications, it is unknown whether medication spending ultimately increases hospital use for Medicare beneficiaries with HF. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between out-of-pocket medication payments and HF-related hospital use among Medicare Part D subscribers. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the 2010-12 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. The sample comprised community-dwelling respondents with fee-for-service Medicare, continuous Part D coverage, and self-reported HF (n = 819 participant-year records). The effects of average out-of-pocket payment for a 30-day HF-related prescription on odds and frequency of hospitalization and total inpatient days attributable to HF were estimated. Design-adjusted models adjusted for sociodemographic and health status variables, survey year and censoring, and included a pre-specified interaction of out-of-pocket payment with Medicaid co-eligibility. RESULTS: The interaction term was statistically significant in all the models. For beneficiaries without Medicaid, average out-of-pocket payment per prescription was not significantly associated with odds of HF-related hospitalization (odds ratio = 1.01, 95\% CI = 0.98-1.05, P = .399). The association between out-of-pocket payment and hospitalization frequency was statistically significant (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.02, 95\% CI = 1.00-1.05, P = .048), as was the association between out-of-pocket payment and total inpatient days (IRR = 1.04, 95\% CI = 1.00-1.08, P = .041). For Medicaid co-eligible beneficiaries, the validity of model estimates is limited, because the range of actual out-of-pocket payments was negligible. CONCLUSIONS: Fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries with Part D, self-reported HF, and no supplemental Medicaid tolerated out-of-pocket medication payments without elevated risk of HF-related hospital use, but medication spending modestly increased hospital use intensity. Therefore, Part D plans with higher out-of-pocket requirements for essential HF medications may warrant additional scrutiny.},

Diabetic end-organ failure, taking insulin only and taking both oral antiglycaemic and insulin, predicted higher HbA1c and fasting blood glucose. African American race and dyslipidaemia predicted higher HbA1c while taking higher total daily medication predicted higher fasting blood glucose. Longer years lived with heart failure, lower ventricular ejection fraction and exposure to chemotherapy predicted lower fasting blood glucose.},

There is a lack of evidence regarding effective interventions to improve nurse well-being and resiliency. PURPOSE: This study used a randomized controlled trial parallel design to test the effectiveness of a 3-hour Community Resiliency Model® (CRM) training, a novel set of sensory awareness techniques to improve emotional balance. METHODS: Registered nurses in two urban tertiary-care hospitals were invited to participate, which entailed attending a single 3-hour "Nurse Wellness and Well-being" class; 196 nurses consented and were randomized into the CRM intervention or nutrition education control group to determine if the CRM group would demonstrate improvement in well-being and resiliency, secondary traumatic stress, burnout, and physical symptoms. FINDINGS: Pre/post data were analyzed for 40 CRM and 37 nutrition group members. Moderate-to-large effect sizes were demonstrated in the CRM group for improved well-being, resiliency, secondary traumatic stress, and physical symptoms. Participants reported using CRM techniques for self-stabilization during stressful work events. DISCUSSION: CRM shows promise as a brief resiliency training for hospital-based nurses.},

Logistic regression was used to test the relationship between baseline strain (Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale, divided into tertiles) and patient likelihood of events (heart failure hospitalization/emergency visit or all-cause mortality) over 8 months. RESULTS: Nearly half of patients (n = 40, 43.5\%) had an event. High (vs low) caregiver strain was associated with a 92.7\% event-risk reduction, but with substantial variability around the effect (odds ratio, 0.07; 95\% confidence interval, 0.01-0.63; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Although findings were similar to the Italian study, the high degree of variability and contrasting findings to other studies signal a level of complexity that warrants further investigation.},

METHODS: 79 adult patients receiving chemotherapy were recruited from an outpatient ambulatory infusion center in the southeastern United States. Patients were separated into two groups (no scent and peppermint) and asked to rate the intensity of their chemotherapy-induced nausea at pre- and postintervention using the Baxter Retching Faces pictorial scale. FINDINGS: The results demonstrated that the use of peppermint oil was effective in decreasing the intensity of nausea experienced by patients compared to a cool washcloth alone.},

The Community Resiliency Model® (CRM) is a novel, simple, body-based set of sensory awareness skills, which focus on “felt-sense” or interoception. We provided a single 5-h Community Resiliency Model® class in an urban drug treatment center for impoverished women in the Southeastern US. Using a pre-post mixed methods design, we collected data from 20 women on well-being, physical symptoms, anger, depression, anxiety, and spirituality. The post-test revealed that participant somatic complaints, anger, and anxiety symptoms had declined significantly, with a moderate to large effect size; well-being increased significantly, with a small effect size. Participants found the skills and concepts of CRM helpful and shared them with others. CRM is a feasible, inexpensive, and acceptable training that may be valuable for persons with addictions.},

abstract = {Heart failure (HF) is a comorbidity that complicates type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) management and increases the chance of death. However, little is known concerning factors related to diabetes self-efficacy in comorbid HF. This secondary data analysis was aimed at describing sociodemographic and clinical correlates of diabetes self-efficacy in adults with T2D and comorbid HF. A correlational design was used to analyze cross-sectional baseline data from a randomized study of 180 participants that tested a 6-month integrated self-care intervention targeting adults with concomitant HF and T2D. Participants were enrolled from one of four large urban-tertiary hospitals in Atlanta, GA, during 2010-2013. Data were collected from medical records and self-report. We used stepwise multiple linear regressions to examine variables associated with diabetes self-efficacy. The participants' mean age was 58.1 ± 10.7 years and the majority were male (n = 118; 65.6\%) and African American (n = 119; 66.1\%). Good self-rated health and presence of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) had significant positive relationships with diabetes self-efficacy, while taking both oral antiglycemic medication and insulin, history of depression, cardiac pacemaker, and taking digitalis were negatively related. These variables collectively explained 22.4\% of the variation in diabetes self-efficacy. One study implication is that using self-rated health provides a quick, patient-centered assessment to evaluate patient health status. Further studies are warranted to ascertain the pathways linking ICD, pacemaker, and digitalis treatment with diabetes self-efficacy.},

abstract = {Hypertension, a modifiable risk factor of cardiovascular disease, is largely responsible for the disproportionate morbidity and mortality in black women. Black women 20 years of age and older have a higher prevalence of HTN compared to white women (44\% vs 28\%). Poor adherence and non-adherence to hypertensive medications have been strongly indicated as a primary contributor to the early onset of disparity in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality experienced by black people. The purpose of this study was to examine medication adherence in black women relative to sociodemographic, clinical, cultural context, psychosocial, cognitive, and behavioral factors. This was a prospective, descriptive cross-sectional study of N = 85, hypertensive black women, with mean age of 39 ± 5.4 years, 18-45 years of age. Variables and measures included: sociodemographic characteristics, clinical, adverse social stressors, psychosocial, cognitive-behavioral factors, and medication adherence. Descriptive statistics, correlations, multivariate logistic regressions, and moderation analysis were tested. 81.2\% (n = 69) of the sample was categorized as non-adherent. SBP was the only clinical covariate associated with HTN medication adherence. HTN illness perceptions, composite score, resilient coping, depressive symptoms, exposure to lifetime gender, and racial stressors, were not associated with HTN medication adherence. Using multivariate logistic regression, decreased SBP and lower scores on the "Consequence" dimension of the HTN illness perception scale were associated with medication adherence (χ2  = 10.53, P = .001). Adherence was associated with both the "Consequence" and "Identity" dimensions of the HTN illness perception scale indicating the need and importance for clinicians to have open and honest communication regarding HTN and its treatment in facilitating adherence.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Constipation after orthopaedic surgery occurs frequently, likely due to a combination of high levels of opioid medications for severe pain management and mobility limitations after surgery. It can result in serious complications, increased cost, and patient discomfort. PURPOSE: This study evaluated a natural food-based fiber solution to prevent constipation in postoperative orthopaedic patients. METHODS: A posttest control group-randomized study design was used. Dependent variables were presence of postoperative constipation, time to first bowel movement (BM), and total number of postoperative BMs. Descriptive statistics, Student's t tests, and Mann-Whitney nonparametric 2-group tests with chi-square analysis were used. Level of significance for all tests was p < .05. Forty-six participants were evaluated. RESULTS: Ages were similar for both the intervention and control groups. Bowel Function Index (BFI) scores were not significantly different (p = .448). No significant group differences were present for the individual BFI item scores (p > .05). The number of patients with a BM during the first 3 days was not significantly different (p = .489). There were no significant differences found between the 2 groups regarding laxative administration (p > .05 for all laxatives). CONCLUSION: Further studies are indicated that address natural fibers and pharmaceutical methods for the prevention of constipation after spinal surgery.},

volume = {38},

abstract = {The ability of patients to adhere to medication regimens is considered critical to achieving optimal results. Many patients are discharged with aspirin (ASA) as an anticoagulant for venous thrombosis embolism prophylaxis after joint replacement surgery. In studies where ASA was prescribed as an antithrombotic after selected orthopaedic surgeries, both lack of understanding and missing doses were identified as factors that affected adherence rates (D. , ). The purpose of this study was to explore the preliminary impact of a preset telephone alarm on medication adherence in adults prescribed ASA for 35 days after knee or hip arthroplasty. This was a randomized controlled trial (n = 79). Adherence was measured with a four-question self-reporting tool. Average age was 61 years. The majority were female (59.5\%) and Caucasian (62.0\%) with college or graduate degree-level education (78.5\%). When comparing the groups, there were no significant differences between the two groups for the demographics of age, gender, and race. The alarm group had significantly better adherence rates, with fewer people who forgot to take their ASA; only 29.7\% of the alarm group ever forgot to take their medication compared with 59.5\% of the no-alarm group (p = .008). It seems that simple cell phone alarms can serve as effective reminders to patients to take selected medications as prescribed.},

abstract = {We report the reliability, validity, and feasibility of self-performed picture pill count (PPC) as an adherence measure that was used in a randomized trial with HIV positive people living in rural Georgia. The first 61 (of 149) participants conducted an additional PPC 1-2 days after baseline. Reliability, measured by a PPC scoring instrument, analyzed participants' ability to reproduce high quality pill count photographs free from artifact or blurring that could hamper accurate visualization of the pills and bottle labels. Except for label blur, baseline photographs (performed with coaching by study staff) and independently performed post-baseline photographs were rated as acceptable quality (> 93\%). Label blur significantly worsened between the baseline and post-baseline scoring (93\% vs 80\%, p = 0.039), possibly indicating that participants required more education to ensure readability. Validity was determined by comparing the number of pills entered into the PC survey with the number of pills in the texted PPC; 77.5\% of participants had perfectly matched pill counts (r = 0.690, p < 0.001). We found PCC to be a reliable and valid method of measuring adherence. The high rate of participant satisfaction underscores its feasibility. It provides an innovative alternative to other more invasive and labor intensive methods of measuring adherence using pill counts.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial correlates of diabetes self-care behaviors in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and comorbid heart failure (HF). METHOD: Baseline data of 180 participants from a clinical trial that tested a 6-month integrated self-care intervention for persons with comorbid HF and T2D were analyzed. Correlational bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to examine correlates of diabetes self-care behaviors. RESULT: Participants had a mean age of 58 ± 11years; the majority were male (n = 118, 66\%) and African American (n = 119, 66\%). Number of comorbidities >2 (P < .001), having more than a high school education (P < .05), and African American ethnicity (P < .05) predicted better exercise, self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG), and foot care behaviors, respectively. The use of an aldosterone inhibitor (P < .05) predicted worse exercise performance, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores (P < .01) predicted worse SMBG, and treatment with diet plus medication (P < .05) and dyslipidemia (P < .001) predicted worse foot care. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study provide new insights into the complex self-care requirements for T2D patients with comorbid HF. Integrated self-care interventions are clearly warranted in persons living with multiple chronic conditions for optimal health outcomes and the prevention of complications. Our sample of predominately African American men showed they had better T2D self-care behaviors than whites than previously reported. Additional research is needed to determine racial and gender differences on health outcomes in persons with T2D and comorbid HF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: African Americans are disproportionately affected by hypertension and have lower medication adherence when compared to other racial groups. Antecedent factors such as beliefs surrounding hypertension, the presence or absence of social support, and depressive symptoms have not been extensively studied collectively in relation to hypertension medication adherence in African Americans. OBJECTIVE: To determine the associations among demographic and clinical factors, depressive symptoms, hypertension beliefs, and social support with blood pressure medication adherence in middle-aged African American adults with a diagnosis of hypertension. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of (N = 120) African Americans (mean age, 49 years; 22.5\% men) with a current diagnosis of metabolic syndrome, including hypertension, who reported having and taking a prescribed blood pressure-lowering medication were included. Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlation analysis, and logistic regression using odds ratio were used to examine the effects of high blood pressure beliefs, social support, and depression on medication adherence. RESULTS: A small but significant relationship was found between medication adherence and number of comorbidities (r = 0.19, P = .04). In a multivariate regression model, after controlling for gender, comorbidities remained associated with medication adherence (β = 0. 77, P = .04). Depressive symptoms, high blood pressure beliefs, and social support did not have a significant relationship with medication adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple comorbidities may have a positive impact upon medication adherence. Further study is needed in a larger sample of African Americans who have a diagnosis of hypertension in addition to other comorbidities requiring medication management.},

year = {2019},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that cost sharing adversely affects appropriate prescription drug use for chronic disorders. However, few studies have evaluated this effect in heart failure (HF), the most common cause of hospitalization in Medicare. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether spending on HF pharmacotherapy by Medicare Part D enrollees was associated with prescription refill adherence. METHODS: This correlational study used pooled data from the 2010-2012 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). The analysis sample consisted of community-dwelling MCBS participants with self-reported HF and continuous Part D coverage during the year of participation. 3 drug classes were analyzed independently: beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). 1,448 weighted participant-year records (derived from 964 individuals) met the inclusion criteria, of which 846 (58\%) were included for beta-blockers, 633 (44\%) for ACE inhibitors, and 229 (16\%) for ARBs. Spending was measured by average out-of-pocket payment for the relevant prescription, standardized to a 30-day supply, as a percentage of average monthly income. Adherence was measured by the medication possession ratio (MPR): total days supplied for all but the last refill divided by number of days between the first and last fills of the year. RESULTS: Accounting for sampling weights, the median (interquartile range) monthly income was \$1,472 (\$949-\$2,466), and average percentage of monthly income spent on a 30-day medication supply was 0.22\% for beta-blockers, 0.19\% for ACE inhibitors, and 0.90\% for ARBs. Mean MPR was 88.9\% for beta-blockers, 88.5\% for ACE inhibitors, and 90.4\% for ARBs. Risk-adjusted models showed that percentage of income spent on a beta-blocker prescription was directly associated with odds of nonadherence (MPR < 80\%), odds ratio = 1.38, 95\% CI = 1.01-1.89, P = 0.045, and inversely associated with beta-blocker MPR, B = -4.17, SE = 1.23, P = 0.001. No such association was observed for ACE inhibitors or ARBs. CONCLUSIONS: Price sensitivity was evident for beta-blockers but not for antiangiotensin drugs, despite very low out-of-pocket costs and high adherence. This study is relevant to value-based pricing of HF management drugs in Part D plans. DISCLOSURES: No outside funding supported this study.

abstract = {Nurse scientists are adept at translating findings from basic science into useful clinical- and community-based interventions to improve health. Over time, the focus of some nursing research has grown to include the assessment and evaluation of genomic and other output from high-throughput, or "omic," technologies as indicators related to health and disease. To date, the growth in the application of omics technologies in nursing research has included calls to increase attention to omics in nursing school curricula and educational training opportunities, such as the Summer Genetics Institute offered by the National Institute of Nursing Research. However, there has been scant attention paid in the nursing literature to the complexity of data analysis or issues of reproducibility related to omics studies. The goals of this article are to (1) familiarize nurse scientists with tools that encourage reproducibility in omics studies, with a focus on the free and open-source data processing and analysis pipeline, and (2) provide a baseline understanding of how these tools can be used to improve collaboration and cohesion among interdisciplinary research team members. Knowledge of these tools and skill in applying them will be important for communication across disciplines and imperative for the advancement of omics research in nursing.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate temperature measurement in patients with cancer is critical. Many patients are neutropenic; therefore, fever represents an oncologic emergency, and, in many cases, it can be the only indication of a life-threatening infection. Although oral thermometers most closely represent true core temperature, patients may have barriers to oral thermometry. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of two alternative, noninvasive thermometers (tympanic and temporal artery) by comparing them to an oral thermometer. METHODS: A method-comparison study design was used. Each participant received three temperature measurements. The dependent variable was the difference in temperature between the test thermometers and the oral thermometer. FINDINGS: The results suggest that neither of the test thermometers accurately represented core temperature, particularly in febrile patients. Both the tympanic and temporal artery thermometers became less accurate as oral temperature increased.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of a personalized, 16-week community-based physical activity intervention for adolescents with diabetes or obesity and examine the weekly patterns of adherence to the intervention. METHODS: Physical activity adherence was evaluated throughout the intervention using accelerometers in 46 adolescents with type 1 diabetes (N = 22), type 2 diabetes (N = 12), or obesity (N = 12) (age, 14.4 ± 1.5 years; 56.5\% female; 61\% Hispanic). Of these, 39 completed the intervention, and 7 did not. RESULTS: There were no differences in baseline anthropometric characteristics or fitness between the completers versus noncompleters. Completers began above 1060 metabolic equivalent (MET) min/wk-1and stayed above 900 MET min/wk-1 for ~4 weeks and declined 39 MET min/wk-1 until end of study. Noncompleters began at 924 MET min/wk-1 yet dropped below 800 MET min/wk-1 by end of week 1 and declined an average of 151 MET min/wk-1. Interestingly, self-report of barriers to activity were higher in completers versus noncompleters. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight that adolescents completing the intervention could sustain a prescribed level of personalized activity for at least 1 month but had steadfast declines in weekly activity. Even with individualized programs, factors other than barriers to activity need to be considered when designing approaches to physical activity adherence for adolescents with diabetes or obesity.},

abstract = {The Integrated Memory Care Clinic (IMCC) is a patient-centered medical home as defined by the National Committee for Quality Assurance directed by advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) caring for persons living with dementia (PLWD); physicians provide specialty consultation but do not direct care or care planning. The IMCC incorporates geriatric nursing, social work, and APRNs from neurology, gerontology, palliative care, and geriatric psychiatry. APRNs provide comprehensive, coordinated primary care for dementia, other chronic conditions, and minor acute illnesses. Partnering with PLWD and families and taking a palliative-oriented, dementia-informed medical home approach, the IMCC aims to reduce dementia burden. This study describes the first 12 months of IMCC's operation with 139 enrolled PLWD-caregiver dyads. All patients have a diagnosis of dementia or mild cognitive impairment; most have Alzheimer's disease (53.2\%). Patients have an average of 5.8 medical conditions and 6.9 prescriptions; 38.1\% have an advanced directive, a medical power of attorney, or a living will. Mean age is 78.6, 63.3\% are female, and 30.9\% are African American. Mean Montreal Cognitive Assessment score is 12.6. Most require assistance in activities of daily living. Many display neuropsychiatric symptoms. The most prevalent comorbidities are hypertension, dyslipidemia, and depression. The rate of ambulatory-sensitive hospitalizations declined from 6.7\% in December 2015 to less than 1\% in May 2016. Caregivers were highly satisfied. We observed nonsignificant improvements in neuropsychiatric symptom severity (p=.07), caregiver distress (p=.69), and caregiver competence (p=.18). IMCC is a novel care model for PLWD and their caregivers and may be a more sustainable model than traditional primary care for this growing vulnerable population.

METHODS: A convenience sample of 22 caregivers from the Atlanta VA and 42 caregivers from 14 different states enrolled in Tele-Savvy. Pre- and post-program evaluations assessed caregiver burden, caregiver competency, and frequency of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). RESULTS: Fifty-seven caregivers completed the 6-week Tele-Savvy program. Caregivers whose care recipients exhibited higher average BPSD frequency at baseline demonstrated significantly greater burden decreases post-program. Caregivers of care recipients in more advanced dementia stages demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in caregiver competence. DISCUSSION: The results point to the feasibility of achieving significant results in caregivers' well-being and care recipients' BPSD with a fully online program. Tele-Savvy may be particularly efficacious for caregivers whose care recipients exhibit higher BPSD frequency and are in later dementia stages.},

In evolutionary terms, one expects more within- than between-gender rivalries, especially since the OR is a place where all sorts of social interactions occur, not merely technical communications. To document the full range of behavior, the present study used ethological observation techniques, recording live all social behavior by the team. Using an ethogram, 6,348 spontaneous social interactions and nontechnical communications were timestamped during 200 surgical procedures. Cooperation sequences (59.0\%) were more frequent than conflict sequences (2.8\%), which ranged from constructive differences of opinion to discord and distraction that could jeopardize patient safety. Behavior varied by clinical role and with the gender composition in the OR. Conflict was initiated mostly down the hierarchy between individuals several ranks apart. Cooperation tended to increase with a rising proportion of females in the OR, but the most pronounced effect concerned the interaction between both genders. If the attending surgeon's gender differed from that of the majority of other personnel in the OR, cooperation was significantly more common.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The African Health Professions Regulatory Collaborative (ARC) was launched in 2011 to support countries in East, Central, and Southern Africa to safely and sustainably expand HIV service delivery by nurses and midwives. While the World Health Organization recommended nurse initiated and managed antiretroviral therapy, many countries in this region had not updated their national regulations to ensure nurses and midwives were authorized and trained to provide essential HIV services. For four years, ARC awarded annual grants, convened regional meetings, and provided technical assistance to country teams of nursing and midwifery leaders to improve national regulations related to safe HIV service delivery. We examined the impact of the program on national regulations and the leadership and organizational capacity of country teams. METHODS: Data was collected to quantify the level of participation in ARC by each country (number of grants received, number of regional meetings attended, and amount of technical assistance received). The level of participation was analyzed according to two primary outcome measures: 1) changes in national regulations and 2) improvements in leadership and organizational capacity of country teams. Changes in national regulations were defined as advancement of one "stage" on a capability maturity model; nursing and midwifery leadership and organizational capacity was measured by a group survey at the end of the program. RESULTS: Seventeen countries participated in ARC between 2012 and 2016. Thirty-three grants were awarded; the majority addressed continuing professional development (20; 61\%) and scopes of practice (6; 18\%). Fourteen countries (representing approximately two-thirds of grants) progressed at least one stage on the capability maturity model. There were significant increases in all five domains of leadership and organizational capacity (p < 0.01). The number of grants (Kendall's tau = 0.56, p = 0.02), duration of technical assistance (Kendall's tau = 0.50, p = 0.03), and number of learning sessions attended (Kendall's tau = 0.46, p = 0.04) were significantly associated with improvements in in-country collaboration between nursing and midwifery organizations. CONCLUSIONS: The ARC program improved national nursing regulations in participating countries and increased reported leadership, organizational capacity, and collaboration among national nursing and midwifery organizations. These changes help ensure national policies and professional regulations underpin nurse initiated and managed treatment for people living with HIV.},

abstract = {Many informal caregivers of persons with dementia suffer adverse health consequences. Although established psychoeducation programs are known to benefit caregivers, attending in-person programs is challenging for them. To address this challenge, the Savvy Caregiver Program, an evidence-based psychoeducation program with demonstrated effectiveness for caregiving and disease-related outcomes, was transformed into an on-line program, Tele-Savvy. This article describes the rationale for and design of a prospective longitudinal randomized controlled trial (targeted N = 215), currently underway. The trial aims to establish Tele-Savvy's efficacy in (i) reducing the negative effects of caregiving on caregivers; (ii) promoting care recipients' quality of life; (iii) improving caregiver mastery; and to explore (iv) Tele-Savvy's efficacy among caregivers of different races/ethnicities. The mediating role of mastery will be assessed. Participants are randomized to the active condition (immediate Tele-Savvy participation), attention control, or usual care. Participants in the two latter conditions will complete Tele-Savvy 6 months post-baseline. Multilevel mixed effects models will be used to examine changes in outcomes and to model group by time (months since baseline) interactions. The exploratory aim will be addressed using analysis of covariance and qualitative analysis. This trial's results may be used by healthcare and community organizations to implement Tele-Savvy in dementia care, increasing caregivers' access to this evidence-based intervention.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Since first being published in 2009, the Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test (AHFKT) has proven a reliable and valid instrument and has been used in multiple studies. Given advances in heart failure (HF) self-care, we proposed to reevaluate the psychometric properties of the AHFKTv2 across these recent studies and update the instrument. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and baseline AHFKTv2 data from 4 intervention studies in persons with HF were combined for this analysis (N = 284). The 30 questions of the AHFKT are focused on 5 HF self-care knowledge domains: pathophysiology, nutrition, behavior, medications, and symptoms. Characteristics of the sample were analyzed using descriptive statistics; validity testing with t tests and Mann-Whitney 2-group tests and Pearson r and Spearman ρ correlations; and reliability calculations and factor analysis were performed based on tetrachoric correlations. RESULTS: Participants were 22 to 84 years of age, 66\% were African American, 63\% were male, and 94\% had New York Heart Association class II to III HF. Mean AHFKT score was 80.6\% (±11\%). Hypotheses that higher levels of knowledge would be associated with higher education level (t = -2.7, P < .01) and less sodium consumption (ρ = -0.22, P = .03) were validated. Factor analysis revealed 1 general knowledge factor with good reliability, Cronbach's α was .87. Item response analysis identified individual questions requiring review and revision. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive psychometric evaluation of the AHFKTv2 confirmed its internal consistency reliability and validity and provided direction for production of the AHFKTv3 available for use in research and clinical practice.},

METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data (N = 114 dyads, 53\% spousal). Patient and caregiver HF knowledge was measured with the Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test. Patient dietary sodium intake was measured by 3-day food record and 24 h urine sodium. Medication adherence was measured by Medication Events Monitoring System caps. Patient HF-related quality of life was measured by the Minnesota Heart Failure Questionnaire; caregiver health-related quality of life was measured by the Short Form-12 Physical Component Summary. Patient and caregiver depression were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Patient and caregiver perceptions of caregiver-provided autonomy support to succeed in heart failure self-care were measured by the Family Care Climate Questionnaire. Multilevel and latent class modeling were used to identify dyadic knowledge configurations. T-tests and chi-square tests were used to characterize differences in sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial characteristics by configuration. Logistic/linear regression were used to quantify relationships between configurations and patient dietary sodium and medication adherence. RESULTS: Two dyadic knowledge configurations were identified: "Knowledgeable Together" (higher dyad knowledge, less incongruence; N = 85, 75\%) and "Knowledge Gap" (lower dyad knowledge, greater incongruence; N = 29, 25\%). Dyads were more likely to be in the "Knowledgeable Together" group if they were White and more highly educated, if the patient had a higher ejection fraction, fewer depressive symptoms, and better autonomy support, and if the caregiver had better quality of life. In unadjusted comparisons, patients in the "Knowledge Gap" group were less likely to adhere to HF medication and diet. In adjusted models, significance was retained for dietary sodium only. CONCLUSIONS: Dyads with higher shared HF knowledge are likely more successful with select self-care adherence behaviors.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between 6-min walk test distance (6MWD) and 30-day readmission in hospitalized heart failure (HF) patients. BACKGROUND: 6MWD is known to predict hospitalizations in outpatients with HF, but its ability to predict recidivism in hospitalized HF patients is relatively unknown. METHODS: Seventy-one hospitalized HF patients with NYHA Class II/III (mean age 52.6 ± 12.3 years, 42.3\% female, 73.2\% African American) performed 6MWD prior to discharge. Logistic regression was used to determine relationships between 6MWD and 30-day readmission. RESULTS: 30-day readmission occurred in 14 (19.7\%) patients. Average 6MWD was 756.4 ± 403.2 feet. Higher 6MWD significantly decreased risk of 30-day readmission, even after adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics (OR = .84, 95\% CI [.71, .99]). For each additional 100 feet walked, odds of a 30-day readmission decreased by 16\%. CONCLUSIONS: 6MWD predicted 30-day readmission in this study, warranting further investigation to understand how the 6MWD may predict readmissions and guide treatment in hospitalized HF patients.},

url = {https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28728761},
volume = {35},
year = {2017},
abstract = {PURPOSE: Co-occurring neurodevelopmental disabilities (including cognitive and language delays and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) affect over half of children with ASD and may affect later behavioral, language, and cognitive outcomes beyond the ASD diagnosis. However, no studies have examined predictors of co-occurring neurodevelopmental disabilities in children with ASD. This study investigated whether maternal sociodemographic, perinatal and neonatal factors are associated with co-occurring disabilities. DESIGN AND METHODS: This study involved a retrospective analysis of medical records for children diagnosed with ASD between 2009 and 2010 at an Autism Center in the southeast United States. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of co-occurring neurodevelopmental disabilities. RESULTS: Of the 385 children in the sample, 61\% had a co-occurring neurodevelopmental disability. Children whose mothers had less education (OR: 0.905), had never been married (OR: 1.803), or had bleeding during pregnancy (OR: 2.233) were more likely to have a co-occurring neurodevelopmental disability. Both preterm birth and African American race were associated with bleeding during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Several maternal and perinatal risk factors for ASD were found to put children at risk for further diagnoses of co-occurring neurodevelopmental disabilities. While prematurity, a well-established risk factor for ASD, as well as maternal ethnicity was not found to increase the risk of a co-occurring disability, this study suggests that bleeding during pregnancy may moderate these relationships. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Understanding maternal, perinatal, and neonatal risk factors may inform healthcare provider screening for ASD and co-occurring neurodevelopmental disabilities by helping providers recognize infants who present with multiple risk factors.},

Patients and families may not recognize that their child is overweight or obese and may not be ready to make change. The goals for this study were to collect overall statistics on the clinic in regards to weight status of children presenting for well child visits and to capture parental perception of the child's weight status in relation to child's age. METHODS: A consecutive sample of parents and caregivers with a child aged 2-18 completed the survey and consented for the study on the day of the survey during a well child visit. CONCLUSIONS: Parents, regardless of culture and age tended to underestimate the weight of their child. These findings further support the literature in that the younger the child, the more likely it is that the parent underestimates their weight status. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Interventions should include early education with parents on what a healthy weight is and how it can predict future health. Addressing and recognizing early concerns and assessing parental perception can be important if educational messages are delivered throughout the span of the early years.},

year = {2017},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is a common comorbidity of heart failure. Little is known about the influence of heart failure symptomatology and coping resources, such as social support and social problem-solving, on depression. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether individual and clinical characteristics, heart failure symptomatology, and the subcomponents of social support and social problem-solving increase the likelihood of depression in outpatients with heart failure. METHODS: A secondary data analysis of a cross sectional study with 201 outpatients with heart failure was conducted. The following self-report questionnaires were used to collect data: the Heart Failure Symptom Survey, the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List-12, the Graven and Grant Social Network Survey, the Social Problem-Solving Inventory Revised-Short, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression scale. Descriptive statistics examined patient characteristics. Logistic regression explored predictors of depression from among individual and clinical characteristics, heart failure symptomatology, and subcomponents of social support (i.e., belonging, tangible, and appraisal support) and social problem-solving (i.e., positive and negative problem orientation; rational, impulsiveness/carelessness, and avoidance problem-solving styles). RESULTS: The sample was primarily Caucasian (86.1\%) male (62.6\%) with an average age of 72.57 years. Individuals who were unmarried, experienced a higher symptom burden, and those who perceived less belonging support were more likely to be depressed. The subcomponents of social problem-solving did not influence depression. CONCLUSIONS: Belonging support was the most beneficial type of social support related to depression. Components of social problem-solving were not related to depression. Assessment of marital status, heart failure symptomatology, and perceived belonging support is needed to identify potential stressors and available social support in order to promote psychological adaptation.},

When FMs had LHL, FMs were more likely to have lower HF knowledge ( p = .001) and patients trended toward higher sodium intake ( p = .067). When both patients and FMs had LHL, lowest HF knowledge and poorest medication adherence were observed ( p < .027). The health literacy of both patient and FM needs to be considered when designing interventions to foster self-care.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether 24\% sucrose solution given orally before insertion of a peripheral intravenous (PIV) catheter decreases neonatal pain. BACKGROUND: Prior studies of pain caused by heel and arterial needlesticks found oral administration of 24\% sucrose to significantly blunt pain during these painful procedures. No studies have evaluated this treatment with needlestick pain associated with PIV catheter insertion. METHODS: Oral 24\% sucrose or placebo solution was administered 2 minutes prior to PIV catheter insertion. Outcome measures were obtained prior to, during, and for 5 minutes after PIV catheter insertion. Investigators and caregivers were blinded to group assignment. Data were analyzed with longitudinal analysis of repeated measures, with P < .05 for significance. RESULTS: A total of 40 neonates (24\% sucrose: N = 20; placebo: N = 20) were studied. Pain scores significantly increased from 3.2 ± 1.6 to a maximum of 7.6 ± 3.8 at the time of catheter insertion, returning to baseline levels 8 minutes after PIV catheter insertion (P < .001). No significant differences were found in pain, heart rate, or noninvasive oxygen saturation (SpO2) between the sucrose and placebo groups (P > 0.05). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Results from this study did not find that 24\% sucrose administered prior to PIV catheter insertion altered the infant's pain response. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Since this is the first study to evaluate the pain-blunting effects of 24\% sucrose administration before PIV catheter insertion, replication of this study is needed before widespread application of findings.},

The reasons for this relationship are not completely understood but may involve endothelial dysfunction. In this study, we hypothesized that insomnia symptoms would be associated with reduced endothelial function. METHODS: Working adults (n = 496, 67.5\% female, 78.6\% white, mean age 48.7 [SD, 10.8] years, body mass index 28.2 [SD, 6.7] kg/m, diabetes 5.8\%, hypertension 20.0\%, hyperlipidemia 17.9\%, heart disease 2.6\%) enrolled in the Emory-Georgia Tech Predictive Health Institute study completed baseline demographic, clinical, depression (Beck Depression Inventory II), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder 7), sleep (Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index), and noninvasive endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation [FMD]) measures. Insomnia symptoms were defined as subjective sleep latency of 30 minutes or longer, nighttime or early morning awakenings, and/or sleep medication use occurring 3 times or more per week in the past month. RESULTS: Insomnia symptoms were reported by 39.5\% of participants. Multivariable regression models showed that insomnia symptoms, age, baseline artery diameter, and dyslipidemia were inversely related to FMD. After adjusting for age, baseline artery diameter, and dyslipidemia, participants reporting insomnia symptoms had lower FMD than did participants reporting better sleep (adjusted FMD mean, 6.13\% [SD, 0.28\%] vs 6.83\% [SD, 0.26\%], P = .035). CONCLUSION: In this study, insomnia symptoms were associated with reduced FMD. Research examining the therapeutic benefits of treating insomnia on endothelial function and future cardiovascular risk is warranted.},

abstract = {Early preterm infants (EPT) (<33 6/7 weeks) are at increased risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) but prevalence estimates vary widely across studies. Furthermore, there are very few studies addressing the association between late preterm (LPT) births (34-36 6/7 weeks) and ASDs. To address the question of whether LPT infants carry the same risk for ASDs as full-term infants, this study aimed to estimate the relative probability of an ASD diagnosis using Bayes rule. A retrospective cohort analysis of 406 children was undertaken to look at gestational age, ASDs, and birth history. The application of Bayes rule was used, given that there is not sufficient information about the joint probabilities related to prematurity and autism. Using the estimated gestational age proportions within ASD diagnosis, plus national estimates of ASDs, probabilities for ASDs within a given gestational age were calculated. Among these 406 children with ASDs, 6.7\% were EPT and 10.6\% were LPT. In comparison to full term, EPT children are at 1.9 multiplicative increase in risk (95\% CI [1.3, 2.5]). While the probability of ASDs for LPT children was higher than that for term, the estimated relative risk of the LPT infants was not statistically significant (95\% CI [0.9, 1.5]). EPT infants were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with ASDs compared to their term peers. While the relative probability of ASD diagnosis among children born LPT was not statistically significant in this limited sample, the results indicate a possible elevated risk. A larger cohort is needed to adequately estimate this risk.},

abstract = {Early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) enables early intervention that improves long term functioning of children with ASD but is often delayed until age of school entry. Few studies have identified factors that affect timely diagnosis. This study addressed how maternal education, race, age, marital status as well as neonatal birth factors affect the age at which a child is diagnosed with ASD. This study involved a retrospective analysis of 664 records of children treated at one of the largest autism treatment centers in the United States from March 1, 2009 to December 30, 2010. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to identify maternal and neonatal factors associated with age of diagnosis. Infant gender, maternal race, marital status, and maternal age were identified as significant factors for predicting the age of ASD diagnosis. In the Cox proportional hazards regression model, only maternal race and marital status were included. Median survival age till diagnosis of children born to married mothers was 53.4 months compared to 57.8 months and 63.7 months of children born to single and divorced or widowed mothers respectively. Median survival age till diagnosis for children of African American mothers was 53.8 months compared to 57.2 months for children of Caucasian mothers. No statistically significant difference of timing of ASD diagnosis was found for children of varying gestational age. Children born to older or married mothers and mothers of minority races were more likely to have an earlier ASD diagnosis. No statistically significant differences in timing of ASD diagnosis were found for children born at varying gestational ages. Identification of these factors has the potential to inform public health outreach aimed at promoting timely ASD diagnosis. This work could enhance clinical practice for timelier diagnoses of ASD by supporting parents and clinicians around the world in identifying risk factors beyond gender and SES and developing strategies to recognize earlier signs of ASD and contribute to improved development outcomes in children with ASD.},

abstract = {Clinical research to identify effective interventions for decreasing nonactionable alarms has been limited. The objective of this study was to determine if a staff educational program on customizing alarm settings on bedside monitors decreased alarms in a medical intensive care unit (MICU). A preintervention, postintervention, nonequivalent group design was used to evaluate an educational program on alarm management in a convenience sample of MICU nurses. A 15-minute session was provided in a 1-week period. The outcome variable (number of alarms for low oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry [SpO2]) was determined from monitor log files adjusted by patient census. Data were collected for 15 days before and after the intervention. χ2 analysis was used, with P less than .05 considered significant. After 1 week of education, low SpO2 alarms decreased from 502 to 306 alarms per patient monitored per day, a 39\% reduction (P < .001). Instructions for nurses in the medical intensive care unit on individualizing alarm settings to patients' clinical condition decreased common monitor alarms by 39\%.},

PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of the EVD Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT) educational program. METHODS: Informational sessions, online course links, and a targeted, self-directed slide presentation were developed and implemented for the EVD educational program. Three student surveys administered at different time points were used to evaluate the program and change in students' EVD knowledge, confidence in knowledge, and risk concern. DISCUSSION: Implementation of a JiTT educational program effectively achieved our goals to increase EVD knowledge, decrease fear, and enhance student confidence in the ability to discuss EVD risk. These achievements were sustained over time. CONCLUSION: JiTT methodology is an effective strategy for schools of nursing to respond quickly and comprehensively during an unanticipated infectious disease outbreak.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart failure self-care requires confidence in one's ability and motivation to perform a recommended behavior. Most self-care occurs within a family context, yet little is known about the influence of family on heart failure self-care or motivating factors. AIMS: To examine the association of family functioning and the self-care antecedents of confidence and motivation among heart failure participants and determine if a family partnership intervention would promote higher levels of perceived confidence and treatment self-regulation (motivation) at four and eight months compared to patient-family education or usual care groups. METHODS: Heart failure patients (N=117) and a family member were randomized to a family partnership intervention, patient-family education or usual care groups. Measures of patient's perceived family functioning, confidence, motivation for medications and following a low-sodium diet were analyzed. Data were collected at baseline, four and eight months. RESULTS: Family functioning was related to self-care confidence for diet (p=0.02) and autonomous motivation for adhering to their medications (p=0.05) and diet (p=0.2). The family partnership intervention group significantly improved confidence (p=0.05) and motivation (medications (p=0.004; diet p=0.012) at four months, whereas patient-family education group and usual care did not change. CONCLUSION: Perceived confidence and motivation for self-care was enhanced by family partnership intervention, regardless of family functioning. Poor family functioning at baseline contributed to lower confidence. Family functioning should be assessed to guide tailored family-patient interventions for better outcomes.},

BACKGROUND: Lowering dietary sodium by HF patients often occurs within the home and family context. METHODS: Secondary analysis of 117 dyads randomized to patient and family education (PFE), family partnership intervention (FPI) or usual care (UC). Dietary sodium measures were obtained from 3-day food record and 24-h urine samples. RESULTS: In the poor family functioning groups, FPI and PFE had lower mean urine sodium than UC (p < .05) at 4 months, and FPI remained lower than UC at 8 months (p < .05). For good family functioning groups, FPI and PFE had lower mean sodium levels by 3-day food record at 4 and 8 months compared to the UC group. CONCLUSION: Optimizing family-focused interventions into HF clinical care maybe indicated.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is little consensus among faculty mentoring programs as to best practices. While there are recommendations in the literature to base faculty development programs on gap analyses of faculty ratings of actual and preferred performance in teaching, scholarship and service, no gap analysis was found in the literature. PURPOSE: Thus, the purpose of this study was to develop a survey tool to benchmark school of nursing (SON) faculty mentorship priorities and conduct a gap analysis of how well they were being addressed. METHODS: Senior faculty who lead mentorship as part of their roles in the SON (associate and assistant deans and director of mentorship) developed a survey through (a) asking faculty members for priorities at in-person mentorship seminars, (b) a review of current nursing literature, and (c) input from the SON mentorship advisory board. The final survey included 37 items focused on general job duties, structure of the mentoring program, time management, as well as skills needed for research, teaching, practice, writing and team science. Responses (rated from 0-not important to 5-very high priority) were requested in 4 areas: the first area focused on how high a priority the respondent rated a given item and areas 2 to 4 focused on how well the need was met by one of three resources: their SON primary assigned mentor, other SON resources, or other university resources. DISCUSSION: There were 63 eligible SON faculty to whom the survey was e-mailed with a 60\% (n = 38) response rate. Most of the respondents were clinical track (42.1\%) followed by tenure track (39.5\%) and research track (15.8\%). Half were assistant professors. The percentage of respondents giving a rating of 4 to 5 were calculated and then ranked. Almost all the faculty responding, regardless of track or rank, desired formal mentorship. Among all faculty, the top five priorities were guidance on producing timely publications (70.4\%), mentorship on work-life balance (68\%), mentorship on putting together a promotion package (61.5\%), guidance on test writing (60\%), and utilizing technology in the classroom (60\%). Priorities varied by faculty track. In terms of the gap between mentorship priorities and how well they were being met, the highest gaps overall were for test writing, using technology in the classroom, curriculum development, lecturing, and developing and managing a research team. As with priorities, the gaps between priorities and how well they were being met varied by track. CONCLUSION: The priorities and gap analysis were used to guide career development program activities and to develop a plan for future mentor-mentee training and activities. The survey tool demonstrated face validity, variability, and preliminary utility as one method for assessing and guiding improvements in faculty mentorship.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in lymphoma survivors by sex. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, correlation. SETTING: Large cancer institute in Southeastern United States. PARTICIPANTS: Participants (N = 31) had a mean age ± standard deviation of 47.6 ± 11.4 years; 55\% were male and 84\% were White. Participants averaged 5 years since lymphoma treatment. METHODS: During one research visit, routine laboratory tests and fasting lipid levels, coronary artery calcification computed tomography, echocardiography, comprehensive questionnaires, survivorship clinic, and cardiology consultation were measured. Analysis consisted of nonparametric Mann Whitney, t, chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Comparison of the presence of subclinical cardiovascular disease, calculated cardiovascular disease risk, cardiovascular health knowledge, lifestyle behaviors, symptomatology, and health related quality of life between men and women. RESULTS: Subclinical disease and/or significant cardiovascular disease risk were found in 42\%. Women tended to be slightly older (p = .07), had slightly lower but nonsignificant 10-year calculated risk, and slightly higher vascular age. Subclinical disease was detected in 35\% of our sample; 28.6\% of the women had diastolic dysfunction. Women scored less than men in health-related quality of life based on results of the Short Form Health Survey Physical Functioning (p = .03) and the EQ-5D Index (p = .04). Women had more symptoms (bloating and diarrhea; p < .05). Those with subclinical disease reported other pain (p < .01), numbness in hands or feet (p < .05), and shortness of breath (p < .05). CONCLUSION: Compared with men, more women than expected had subclinical disease, specifically diastolic dysfunction; less reported functioning and health-related quality of life, and greater symptoms. Of clinical relevance is the need for assessment of symptoms that could herald subclinical disease with timely referral.},

We analyzed baseline data from 193 predominately African American HIV-infected women participating in a behavioral clinical trial. Women were categorized into high/low groups based on levels of adherence and risky behaviors. There was a significant interaction effect for internal motivation for adherence. Women at high risk for poor health and transmitting HIV (low adherence/high risk group) had the lowest levels of internal motivation and also reported more difficult life circumstances. Gender roles, caretaking and reliance on men for economic and other support may promote external versus internal motivation as well as riskier behaviors in this group. The highest levels of internal motivation were found in those with High Adherence/High Risk behaviors. This group was highly knowledgeable about HIV and had the lowest VL. Compared to others, this group seems to tolerate risky behaviors given their high level of adherence. Adherence and risk reduction behaviors are key to individual and public health. Motivation and risk compensation should be addressed when providing interventions to women living with HIV.},

METHODS: Survey development included (a) 2-phase integrative literature reviews; (b) draft of survey items based on the literature; (c) critique of survey items by young adults, nursing and psychology faculty, and health care providers; and (d) pilot testing. The psychometric properties of the SHPVS were evaluated using classical item analysis and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) among a sample of 527 university students' ages 18-24 years. RESULTS: The estimated Cronbach's alpha for the SHPVS is .74. CONCLUSIONS: The SHPVS is a measure of young adults HPV perceived vulnerability, perceived severity, perceived barriers, and perceived benefits of HPV vaccination.},

volume = {201},
year = {2015},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adults with congenital heart defects (ACHD) face long-term complications related to prior surgery, abnormal anatomy, and acquired cardiovascular conditions. Although self-care is an important part of chronic illness management, few studies have explored self-care in the ACHD population. The purpose of this study is to describe self-care and its antecedents in the ACHD population. METHODS: Persons with moderate or severe ACHD (N=132) were recruited from a single ACHD center. Self-care (health maintenance behaviors, monitoring and management of symptoms), and potential antecedents including sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, ACHD knowledge, behavioral characteristics (depressive symptoms and self-efficacy), and family-related factors (parental overprotection and perceived family support) were collected via self-report and chart review. Multiple regression was used to identify antecedents of self-care maintenance, monitoring, and management. RESULTS: Only 44.7\%, 27.3\%, and 23.3\% of participants performed adequate levels of self-care maintenance, monitoring and management, respectively. In multiple regression analysis, self-efficacy, education, gender, perceived family support, and comorbidities explained 25\% of the variance in self-care maintenance (R(2)=.248, F(5, 123)=9.44, p<.001). Age, depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, and NYHA Class explained 23\% of the variance in self-care monitoring (R(2)=.232, F(2, 124)=10.66, p<.001). Self-efficacy and NYHA Class explained 9\% of the variance in self-care management (R(2)=.094, F(2, 80)=5.27, p=.007). CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of self-care are common among persons with ACHD. Multiple factors, including modifiable factors of self-efficacy, depressive symptoms, and perceived family support, are associated with self-care and should be considered in designing future interventions to improve outcomes in the ACHD population.},

url = {https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24990176},
volume = {14},
year = {2015},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fluid restriction (FR) in persons with heart failure (HF) is often prescribed, yet self-regulation and the troublesome symptom of thirst are difficult for patients to manage. AIMS: The purpose of this pilot study was to test an educational and behavioral intervention (EBI) on adherence with prescribed FR and outcome measures of fluid congestion, symptom distress, and health related quality of life (HRQL). Secondary aims were to describe the relationships between self-reported and objectively measured determinants of fluid status and symptoms, and assess the psychometric properties of piloted instruments, and intervention effect sizes. METHODS: NYHA Class II-IV (n=25, 44-83 years, 56\% male, 20\% minority, mean EF 23.0+11.7\%) participants were randomized to the EBI or attention control (AC) and evaluated at baseline, 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: EBI patients trended toward decreasing fluid ingestion (p=0.08), experienced less HF symptom frequency (p=0.13) and severity (p=0.06), and increased symptoms of thirst (p<0.01) across time. Whereas HRQL remained stable in the EBI group, it improved in the AC group over time (p=0.01). There were no significant differences in clinical measures of fluid congestion between groups. CONCLUSIONS: These outcomes suggest that patients receiving the EBI drank slightly less fluid, experienced less typical HF symptoms, greater thirst distress and stable HRQOL. Moderate to large effect sizes for the measures used were observed, and outcomes suggest that a randomized trial of various levels of FR would not potentiate fluid congestion but should specifically address preservation of HRQOL and thirst symptoms.},

year = {2015},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prior studies have evaluated only the prolonged use of cryotherapy as a nonpharmacologic pain intervention. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a 30-minute application of cryotherapy at the time pain medication was given after a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) provided better pain relief than analgesic drugs alone. METHODS: A pretest, posttest, randomized controlled trial study design with crossover was used to evaluate the effects of cryotherapy on postoperative pain and satisfaction with pain management. A convenience sample of postoperative knee replacement patients constituted participants in the study. Two sequential episodes of pain requiring analgesic administration were studied in each patient, one with a 30-minute cryotherapy application and the other without cryotherapy. Dependent variables were changes in pain (posttest minus pretest) and level of satisfaction with pain management. Data were analyzed with repeated-measures analysis of variance, with p < .05 considered significant. RESULTS: During two sequential treatments for postoperative pain, a total of 29 TKA patients received analgesic medication administration alone for one pain episode and analgesic medication administration with a brief cryotherapy administration for the other pain episode. No significant difference between the two treatments was found for changes in pain scores after the treatments or patient satisfaction with pain management (p > .05). The order in which the treatments were provided was found to be significant (p = .02) for scores on patient satisfaction with pain management, with cryotherapy as the treatment for the second pain episode having higher scores than when delivered for the first pain episode. Sixty minutes after analgesic administration with or without cryotherapy, average pain scores remained greater than 7. CONCLUSION: In TKA patients, the short-term application of cryotherapy with analgesic medication administration did not significantly decrease pain or improve patient satisfaction with pain management compared with analgesic medication administration only. Further study is necessary to determine whether short-term cryotherapy shortly after TKA is of benefit to pain relief and patient satisfaction.},

METHODS: Using a single subject analysis design, time series analyses models were constructed for each of the five patients for a period of 180 days to determine correlations between daily measures of patient reported fluid intake, thoracic impedance, and weights, and relationships between patient reported outcomes of symptom burden and health related quality of life over time. RESULTS: Negative relationships were observed between fluid intake and thoracic impedance, and between impedance and weight, while positive correlations were observed between daily fluid intake and weight. CONCLUSIONS: By constructing time series analyses of daily measures of fluid congestion, trends and patterns of fluid congestion emerged which could be used to guide individualized patient care or future research endeavors. Employment of such a specialized analysis technique allows for the elucidation of clinically relevant findings potentially disguised when only evaluating aggregate outcomes of larger studies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore biopsychosocial factors (beliefs, depression, catastrophizing cytokines) in individuals newly diagnosed with lung cancer and no pain to determine their relationship at diagnosis and across time and to determine whether these factors contribute to pain intensity or pain interference with function at pain onset. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A longitudinal, exploratory, pilot study was implemented in a private medical center and a VA medical center in the southeast. Twelve subjects not experiencing pain related to cancer of the lung or its treatment were recruited. A Karnofsky status of 40\% and hemoglobin of 8 g were required. Five questionnaires were completed and 10 mL of blood was drawn at baseline; 4 questionnaires and blood draws were repeated monthly for 5 months. One baseline questionnaire and a pain assessment were added at final. Demographic, clinical, and questionnaire data were summarized; standardized scale scores were calculated. RESULTS: Biopsychosocial scores that were low at baseline increased from T1-T4 but decreased slightly T5-T6. Individuals with higher pain intensity and higher pain interference at final had higher psychosocial scores at baseline than individuals with lower pain intensity and lower pain interference at final. CONCLUSIONS: Unrelated to disease stage, metastasis, or treatment, unique levels of biopsychosocial factors are observed in patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer who report higher levels of pain intensity and higher levels of pain interference at the time pain occurs. Replication studies are needed to validate this response pattern and determine the value of repeated individual assessments.},

year = {2015},
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Persons with concomitant heart failure (HF) and diabetes mellitus (DM) have complicated, often competing, self-care expectations and treatment regimens that may reduce quality of life (QOL). This randomized controlled trial tested an integrated self-care intervention on outcomes of HF and DM QOL, physical function, and physical activity (PA). METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants with HF and DM (n = 134; mean age 57.4 ± 11 years, 66\% men, 69\% minority) were randomized to usual care (control) or intervention. The control group received standard HF and DM educational brochures with follow-up telephone contact. The intervention group received education and counseling on combined HF and DM self-care (diet, medications, self-monitoring, symptoms, and PA) with follow-up home visit and telephone counseling. Measures included questionnaires for HF- and DM-specific and overall QOL, PA frequency, and physical function (6-min walk test [6MWT]) and were obtained at baseline and 3 and 6 months. Analysis included mixed models with a priori post hoc tests. Adjusting for age, body mass index, and comorbidity, the intervention group improved in HF total (P = .002) and physical (P < .001) QOL scores at 3 months with retention of improvements at 6 months, improved in emotional QOL scores compared with control at 3 months (P = .04), and improved in health status ratings (P = .04) at 6 months compared with baseline. The intervention group improved in 6MWT distance (924 ft to 952 ft; P = .03) whereas the control group declined (834 ft to 775 ft; F1,63 = 6.86; P = .01). The intervention group increased self-reported PA between baseline and 6 months (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: An integrated HF and DM self-care intervention improved perceived HF and general QOL but not DM QOL. Improved physical functioning and self-reported PA were also observed with the integrated self-care intervention. Further study of the HF and DM integrated self-care intervention on other outcomes, such as hospitalization and cost, is warranted.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Persons with concomitant heart failure (HF) and diabetes mellitus constitute a growing population whose quality of life is encumbered with worse clinical outcomes as well as high health resource use (HRU) and costs. METHODS AND RESULTS: Extensive data on HRU and costs were collected as part of a prospective cost-effectiveness analysis of a self-care intervention to improve outcomes in persons with both HF and diabetes. HRU costs were assigned from a Medicare reimbursement perspective. Patients (n = 134) randomized to the self-care intervention and those receiving usual care/attention control were followed for 6 months, revealing significant differences in the number of hospitalization days and associated costs between groups. The mean number of inpatient days was 3 with bootstrapped bias-corrected (BCa) confidence intervals (CIs) of 1.8-4.4 d for the intervention group and 7.3 d (BCa CI 4.1-10.9 d) in the control group: P = .044. Total direct HRU costs per participant were an estimated \$9,065 (BCa CI \$6,496-\$11,936) in the intervention and \$16,712 (BCa CI 8,200-\$26,621) in the control group, for a mean difference of -\$7,647 (BCa CI -\$17,588 to \$809; P = .21) in favor of the intervention, including intervention costs estimated to be \$130.67 per patient. CONCLUSIONS: The self-care intervention demonstrated dominance in lowering costs without sacrificing quality-adjusted life-years.},

abstract = {We sought to examine the course of adherence and cognition in HIV-infected individuals with either cocaine or heroin dependence and investigate independent predictors of cognition change. A prospective study over six months was undertaken in which adherence was measured by monthly electronic pill cap monitoring (Medication Event Monitoring System), while a comprehensive neuropsychological battery resulting in a composite score (NPZ8) was performed at baseline and six months. Multivariable regression models were performed in order to determine independent associations with change in cognition. There were 101 subjects at baseline, of whom 62\% were male and 83\% were non-Hispanic black. 46.6\% of subjects at baseline had completed high school, 36.6\% reported active cocaine use during the course of the study, and 0\% reported active heroin use during the course of the study. 66 subjects completed the final cognitive assessment at six months. Subjects had markedly impaired cognitive function at baseline (NPZ8 -1.49) which persisted at six months (NPZ8 -1.47) in the group of study completers. There was an average monthly decrease in adherence of -2.91\% overall (p = 0.008). In the multivariable model, each of the following variables: baseline cognition (R(2) change = 0.121, p = 0.006), cocaine use during the study (R(2) change = 0.059, p = 0.046), and monthly adherence change (R(2) change = 0.078, p = 0.018) independently contributed to NPZ8 change with an overall R(2) change = 0.219 (p = 0.001). This study shows an overall decrease in adherence over time in this population of subjects with a history of drug dependence. Active cocaine use, baseline cognition, and temporal adherence changes independently contributed to changes in cognition. Further study on enhancing adherence, cognition, and limiting drug abuse are warranted in this subgroup of HIV-infected individuals.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate two methods of rewarming newborns after the first bath: radiant rewarming and skin-to-skin maternal newborn contact. DESIGN: A nonrandomized clinical trial in which mothers chose the rewarming method, with 200 participants in the skin-to-skin rewarming group (experimental condition), and 200 in the radiant rewarming group (control). SETTING: A teaching hospital in the Southeast United States. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy, term infants after vaginal delivery. METHODS: Newborn temperatures were taken immediately prior to the bath (T1), and 30 minutes (T2) and 60 minutes (T3) after the bath. Descriptive statistics and t tests were used to determine differences between groups and between time points. Logistic regression was employed to assess risk factors for newborns with temperatures less than 36.4°C 30 minutes after the bath. RESULTS: Because 96 of the first 100 mothers chose skin-to-skin rewarming, we concluded the study early and analyzed the data. Of the 96 mothers who chose skin-to-skin, 91 infants were successfully rewarmed and five required rescue rewarming under the radiant warmer. Careful review of newborns requiring rescuing showed inadequate skin-to-skin contact or removal of the protective covering. In this sample, African American mothers were significantly younger, had smaller newborns, and their newborns had lower temperatures than non-African American newborns. CONCLUSIONS: Given a choice, mothers overwhelmingly preferred skin-to-skin rewarming. Newborns can safely rewarm skin-to-skin if staff pay special attention to how they are positioning the newborn and recheck mother and newborn frequently. The unexpected finding of racial differences in maternal and newborn characteristics will require further investigation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with nonsurgical pain (NSP) after a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) report different patterns of pain interference than those without NSP. PURPOSE: This study explores the severity and ways in which NSP interferes with activities 48 hours and 6-7 weeks post surgery. ANALYSIS: Univariate and multivariate analyses were used. The mean score for intensity at 48 hours was 1.78, and at 6-7 weeks it was 1.15. The mean score for interference with activities at 48 hours was 1.62 and at 6-7 weeks it was 0.91. Highest NSP pain interference at 48 hours was for "activity," "sleep," and "enjoyment of life." At 6-7 weeks, the highest scores were for "activity," "sleep," and "walking." No significant differences were noted for age, race, education, or gender. IMPLICATIONS: Although rated "mild," this pain should be addressed. The NSP indicates a baseline of chronic and persistent pain, which is an opportunity to work with our patients to mitigate this pain. Total knee arthroplasty, a common and effective treatment for painful knee conditions attributed to various forms of arthritis, is known to be a painful surgical procedure. Two of the major concerns voiced by patients awaiting TKA are about postoperative pain management and rehabilitation efforts after the procedure (). Healthcare providers offer a range of methods and strategies to deal with postoperative TKA pain, yet to date no single method offers complete satisfaction (; ; ; ).},

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to describe (a) the prevalence of self-reported sleep problems among ASCC before treatment, during treatment, following treatment, and in survivorship follow-up; (b) the relationship between sleep problems and self-reported adverse psychosocial outcomes; and (c) the relationship between sleep problems, treatment, and disease. METHODS: Baseline surveys were received from 173 ASCC aged 13-19 years. Chi-square analyses and odds ratios were used to determine associations between sleep problems and adverse psychosocial outcomes and treatment-related variables. FINDINGS: Sleep problems were reported before treatment (6\%), during treatment (18\%), after treatment (15\%), and at present (11\%). ASCC reporting sleep problems reported more adverse psychosocial outcomes than those without. Significant associations (p ≤ 0.05) between sleep problems and difficulty in school were identified at all time points. Sleep problems were associated with depressive symptoms, memory problems, and anxiety during and after treatment and at present.},

volume = {27},
year = {2015},
abstract = {Social subordination in macaque females is a known chronic stressor and previous studies have shown that socially subordinate female rhesus monkeys consume fewer kilocalories than dominant animals when a typical laboratory chow diet is available. However, in a rich dietary environment that provides access to chow in combination with a more palatable diet (i.e. high in fat and refined sugar), subordinate animals consume significantly more daily kilocalories than dominant conspecifics. Substantial literature is available supporting the role of stress hormone signals in shaping dietary preferences and promoting the consumption of palatable, energy-dense foods. The present study was conducted using stable groups of adult female rhesus monkeys to test the hypothesis that pharmacological treatment with a brain penetrable corticotrophin-releasing factor type 1 receptor (CRF1) antagonist would attenuate the stress-induced consumption of a palatable diet among subordinate animals in a rich dietary environment but would be without effect in dominant females. The results show that administration of the CRF1 receptor antagonist significantly reduced daily caloric intake of both available diets among subordinate females compared to dominant females. Importantly, multiple regression analyses showed that the attenuation in caloric intake in response to Antalarmin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) was significantly predicted by the frequency of submissive and aggressive behaviour emitted by females, independent of social status. Taken together, the findings support the involvement of activation of CRF1 receptors in the stress-induced consumption of excess calories in a rich dietary environment and also support the growing literature concerning the importance of CRF for sustaining emotional feeding.},

This study examined the role of age as a possible moderator of the relationship between stigma and antiretroviral therapy adherence, CD4\% and viral load among 120 HIV-infected women. A secondary analysis was conducted using data from the Keeping Healthy and Active with Risk Reduction and Medication Adherence (KHARMA) Project, an National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded randomized controlled trial to improve Antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence and reduce risky behaviors in HIV-infected women at five clinical sites in a South-eastern city from 2005 to 2008. Stigma was measured using the Perceived Personal Stigma of Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) scale. Among participants <50 years old (n=90), age was significantly associated with viral load (rho=-.24, p=.02) and stigma was negatively associated with CD4\% (r =-.26, p=.02). For the 30 participants >50 years old, age was not significantly associated with viral load, stigma or CD4\%, and there was no significant association between stigma and CD4\% (r=.07, p=.70). These findings indicate the need for further study regarding this potential moderating effect and possible interventions to address the susceptibility of younger women to the harmful effects of stigma.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although family influences in heart failure (HF) care are considered important, little evidence is available regarding relationships between the family context and specific outcomes for patients with HF. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the relationships of patient perceptions of family functioning, autonomy support, and perceived criticism, as well as their family member's (FM) HF knowledge, with patient outcomes of depressive symptoms and HF quality of life (QOL). METHODS: Participants (n = 117) with HF were enrolled in a family partnership intervention study. Self-report questionnaires measuring the HF patient's perceptions of family context and the FM's knowledge were analyzed relative to the HF patient's outcomes using correlations and sequential multivariate regression analyses. Only preintervention, baseline data are reported here. RESULTS: Age, ethnicity, Charlson comorbidity index, global family functioning, and FM's HF knowledge accounted for 37.8\% (P < .001) of the variance in the patient's depressive symptoms. An additional moderating effect of ethnicity on the association between global family functioning and patient's depressive symptoms was significant (change R2 = 0.06, P = .001), resulting in a final model that accounted for 43.3\% of depressive symptom variance. Age, ethnicity, global family functioning, and autonomy support accounted for 24.9\% (P < .001) of the variance in emotional HF QOL. An additional moderating effect of ethnicity on the association between global family functioning and patient's emotional HF QOL was significant (change R2 = 0.05, P = .009), resulting in a final model that accounted for 28.9\% of emotional QOL variance. CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores the importance of the patient's perspective on family functioning and autonomy support, along with FM's HF knowledge, on HF patient outcomes moderated by ethnicity. Future interventions could target the modifiable patient-family context relationships for improving depressive symptoms and QOL in HF patients. These findings point to the need for greater family assessment to identify those at risk for worse outcomes and to guide family focused interventions.},

year = {2014},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given the global nursing shortage and investments to scale-up the workforce, this study evaluated trends in annual student nurse enrolment, pre-service attrition between enrolment and registration, and factors that influence nurse production in Kenya. METHODS: This study used a mixed methods approach with data from the Regulatory Human Resources Information System (tracks initial student enrolment through registration) and the Kenya Health Workforce Information System (tracks deployment and demographic information on licensed nurses) for the quantitative analyses and qualitative data from key informant interviews with nurse training institution educators and/or administrators. Trends in annual student nurse enrolment from 1999 to 2010 were analyzed using regulatory and demographic data. To assess pre-service attrition between training enrolment and registration with the nursing council, data for a cohort that enrolled in training from 1999 to 2004 and completed training by 2010 was analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to test for factors that significantly affected attrition. To assess the capacity of nurse training institutions for scale-up, qualitative data was obtained through key informant interviews. RESULTS: From 1999 to 2010, 23,350 students enrolled in nurse training in Kenya. While annual new student enrolment doubled between 1999 (1,493) and 2010 (3,030), training institutions reported challenges in their capacity to accommodate the increased numbers. Key factors identified by the nursing faculty included congestion at clinical placement sites, limited clinical mentorship by qualified nurses, challenges with faculty recruitment and retention, and inadequate student housing, transportation and classroom space. Pre-service attrition among the cohort that enrolled between 1999 and 2004 and completed training by 2010 was found to be low (6\%). CONCLUSION: To scale-up the nursing workforce in Kenya, concurrent investments in expanding the number of student nurse clinical placement sites, utilizing alternate forms of skills training, hiring more faculty and clinical instructors, and expanding the dormitory and classroom space to accommodate new students are needed to ensure that increases in student enrolment are not at the cost of quality nursing education. Student attrition does not appear to be a concern in Kenya compared to other African countries (10 to 40\%).},

abstract = {Studies show 30\% to 47\% of people with heart failure (HF) have concomitant diabetes mellitus (DM). Self-care for persons with both of these chronic conditions is conflicting, complex, and often inadequate. This pilot study tested an integrated self-care program for its effects on HF and DM knowledge, self-care efficacy, self-care behaviors, and quality of life (QOL). Hospitalized HF-DM participants (N = 71) were randomized to usual care or intervention using a 1:2 allocation and followed at 30 and 90 days after intervention. Intervention was an integrated education and counseling program focused on HF-DM self-care. Variables included demographic and clinical data, knowledge about HF and DM, HF- and DM-specific self-efficacy, standard HF and DM QOL scales, and HF and DM self-care behaviors. Analysis included descriptive statistics, multilevel longitudinal models for group and time effects, post hoc testing, and effect size calculations. Sidak adjustments were used to control for type 1 error inflation. The integrated HF-DM self-care intervention conferred effects on improved HF knowledge (30 days, p = .05), HF self-care maintenance (30 and 90 days, p < .001), HF self-care management (90 days, p = .05), DM self-efficacy (30 days, p = .03; 90 days, p = .004), general diet (30 days, p = .05), HF physical QOL (p = .04), and emotional QOL scores (p = .05) at 90 days within the intervention group. The participants in the usual care group also reported increased total and physical QOL. Greater percentages of participants in the intervention group improved self reported exercise between 0 and 30 days (p = .005 and moderate effect size ES = .47) and foot care between 0 and 90 days (p = .03, small ES = .36). No group differences or improvements in DM-specific QOL were observed. An integrated HF-DM self-care intervention was effective in improving essential components of self-care and had sustained (90 day) effects on selected self-care behaviors.

abstract = {Nurse investigators often collect study data in the form of counts. Traditional methods of data analysis have historically approached analysis of count data either as if the count data were continuous and normally distributed or with dichotomization of the counts into the categories of occurred or did not occur. These outdated methods for analyzing count data have been replaced with more appropriate statistical methods that make use of the Poisson probability distribution, which is useful for analyzing count data. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the Poisson distribution and its use in Poisson regression. Assumption violations for the standard Poisson regression model are addressed with alternative approaches, including addition of an overdispersion parameter or negative binomial regression. An illustrative example is presented with an application from the ENSPIRE study, and regression modeling of comorbidity data is included for illustrative purposes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the mesenteric tissue oxygenation response in preterm infants fed and not fed during red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, observational comparison of mesenteric oxygenation using near-infrared spectroscopy in preterm infants (<33 weeks' at birth) who were fed or not fed during RBC transfusion. Tissue oxygenation means were examined up to 48 hours after each transfusion event. RESULTS: Mean mesenteric regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) slopes during RBC transfusion of fed (n = 9) vs not fed (n = 8) infants ranged from -0.23 to +0.23 (mean 0.04) with no differences between groups (P = .480). However, following transfusions, postprandial mesenteric oxygenation means significantly declined in infants fed during transfusion compared with infants not fed during transfusion (P < .001). Infants fed during RBC transfusion had a mean 2.16 point decrease in rSO2 mesenteric oxygenation with each sequential feeding post-transfusion, whereas infants not fed during RBC transfusion increased their rSO2 postprandial mesenteric oxygenation by a mean of 2.09 points. CONCLUSIONS: Mesenteric tissue oxygenation during RBC transfusion is not influenced by feeding status. However, infants fed during RBC transfusion had, for the next 15 hours, decreasing postprandial mesenteric tissue oxygenation patterns compared with infants not fed during RBC transfusion. Feeding during RBC transfusions may increase the risk for mesenteric ischemia and the development of transfusion-related necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lowering dietary sodium and adhering to medication regimens are difficult for persons with heart failure (HF). Because these behaviors often occur within the family context, this study evaluated the effects of family education and partnership interventions on dietary sodium (Na) intake and medication adherence (MA). METHODS AND RESULTS: HF patient and family member (FM) dyads (n = 117) were randomized to: usual care (UC), patient-FM education (PFE), or family partnership intervention (FPI). Dietary Na (3-day food record), urinary Na (24-hour urine), and MA (Medication Events Monitoring System) were measured at baseline (BL) before randomization, and at 4 and 8 months. FPI and PFE reduced urinary Na at 4 months, and FPI differed from UC at 8 months (P = .016). Dietary Na decreased from BL to 4 months, with both PFE (P = .04) and FPI (P = .018) lower than UC. The proportion of subjects adherent to Na intake (≤2,500 mg/d) was higher at 8 months in PFE and FPI than in UC (χ(2)(2) = 7.076; P = .029). MA did not differ among groups across time. Both FPI and PFE groups increased HF knowledge immediately after intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary Na intake, but not MA, was improved by PFE and FPI compared with UC. The UC group was less likely to be adherent with dietary Na. Greater efforts to study and incorporate family-focused education and support interventions into HF care are warranted.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that antecedent red blood cell (RBC) transfusions increase the risk for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), the most common gastrointestinal emergency encountered by very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants. The underlying mechanism for this association is unknown. Altered oxygenation of the mesenteric vasculature during RBC transfusion has been hypothesized to contribute to NEC development and was investigated in this study. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Oxygenation patterns among four VLBW infants who developed transfusion-related NEC (TR-NEC) were compared to four VLBW infants with similar gestational age who were transfused but did not develop NEC (non-NEC). Cerebral and mesenteric patterns were recorded before, during, and 48 hours after RBC transfusion using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology. Percentage change from mean baseline regional oxygen saturation values and cerebrosplanchnic oxygenation ratios were analyzed. RESULTS: All TR-NEC infants (24-29 weeks' gestation; 705-1080 g) demonstrated greater variation in mesenteric oxygenation patterns surrounding transfusions than non-NEC infants (27.6-30 weeks' gestation; 980-1210 g). TR-NEC infants received larger mean volumes of total blood (27.75 ± 8.77 mL/kg) than non-NEC infants (15.25 ± 0.5 mL/kg). CONCLUSION: Wide fluctuation and decreases in mesenteric oxygenation patterns are more pronounced in TR-NEC infants, especially before TR-NEC onset, compared to non-NEC infants. Greater total volume of infused blood was associated with TR-NEC in preterm infants. Using NIRS, larger prospective studies are needed to further evaluate potential risk factors for NEC in this high-risk population.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the quality and adequacy of dietary intake in patients attempting to limit sodium. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive analysis of the dietary intake of persons with heart failure (HF) in the Southern United States who have been advised to limit their sodium intake. METHODS: Three-day food diaries were completed by 114 New York Heart Association class II and III persons with HF enrolled in a family partnership intervention study, which were reviewed by a dietitian and analyzed using validated nutritional software. The Harris-Benedict equation for sedentary adults was used to determine macronutrient intake adequacy. Demographic information and clinical data were obtained through patient report and medical record review. RESULTS: Dietary sodium ingestion ranged from 522 to 9251 mg/d (mean [SD], 2671 [1432] mg/d), with 38 (33.3\%) individuals consuming the recommended 2000 mg/d or less in this sample (age, 28-78 years; 64.0\% men; 57.0\% African American). Mean (SD) caloric intake for the total sample was 1674 (636) kcal/d, with participants eating 99\% of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of protein, 63\% of the RDA of carbohydrates, and 89\% of the RDA of fat. Participants eating 2000 mg or less of sodium consumed significantly less calories (P < .001), protein (P < .001), carbohydrates (P = .008), and fat (P < .001), but not fiber (P = .103), compared with those consuming more than 2000 mg of sodium after adjusting for body mass index. When analyzed by amount of sodium consumption, persons ingesting 2000 mg or less of sodium per day ate significantly less grains (P = .001) and meat and beans (P = .004) and had less intake of the micronutrients calcium (P < .001), zinc (P = .002), and thiamine (P = .05). CONCLUSION: Only one-third of participants with HF who have been instructed on a low-sodium diet reported consuming the RDA of 2000 mg or less, indicating the need for further dietary instruction with a particular focus on modifying the Southern US diet.},

title = {Social and emotional predictors of the tempo of puberty in female rhesus monkeys.},
url = {https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22658962},
volume = {38},
year = {2013},
abstract = {A cascade of neuroendocrine events regulates the initiation and progression of female puberty. However, the factors that determine the timing of these events across individuals are still uncertain. While the consequences of puberty on subsequent emotional development and adult behavior have received significant attention, what is less understood are the social and environmental factors that actually alter the initiation and progression of puberty. In order to more fully understand what factors influence pubertal timing in females, the present study quantified social and emotional behavior; stress physiology; and growth and activity measures in juvenile female rhesus monkeys to determine what best predicts eventual puberty. Based on previous reports, we hypothesized that increased agonistic behavior resulting from subordinate status in their natal group, in combination with slowed growth, reduced prosocial behavior, and increased emotional reactivity would predict delayed puberty. The analyses were restricted to behavioral and physiological measures obtained prior to the onset of puberty, defined as menarche. Together, our findings indicate that higher rates of aggression but lower rates of submission received from group mates; slower weight gain; and greater emotional reactivity, evidenced by higher anxiety, distress and appeasing behaviors, and lower cortisol responsivity in response to a potentially threatening situation, predicts delayed puberty. Together the combination of these variables accounted for 58\% of the variance in the age of menarche, 71\% in age at first ovulation, and 45\% in the duration of adolescent sterility. While early puberty may be more advantageous for the individual from a fertility standpoint, it presents significant health risks, including increased risk for a number of estrogen dependent cancers and as well as the emergence of mood disorders during adulthood. On the other hand, it is possible that increased emotional reactivity associated with delayed puberty could persist, increasing the risk for emotional dysregulation to socially challenging situations. The data argue for prospective studies that will determine how emotional reactivity shown to be important for pubertal timing is affected by early social experience and temperament, and how these stress-related variables contribute to body weight accumulation, affecting the neuroendocrine regulation of puberty.},

ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis were used to assess the data. FINDINGS: Of the participants, 12\% reported severe pain and 35\% reported severe interference with general activities. Pain interfered most with walking, activities, and physical therapy. There were no differences by race, gender, or education. Older participants reported less pain and less interference. Participants reporting nonsurgical pain reported more interference with mood, walking, relationships with other people, and sleep. RECOMMENDATIONS: Pain evaluation should include an assessment of pain unrelated to the surgical procedure. Additional research exploring the impact of nonpostoperative surgical pain during the postoperative period is needed.},

The Parental Human Papillomavirus Survey (PHPVS) was framed on theoretical constructs of the health belief model (HBM) and developed to survey parents regarding their HPV knowledge, attitudes, and intent to vaccinate. METHODS: We evaluated the psychometric properties of the PHPVS using classical item analysis and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) among a sample of 200 parents/caregivers. RESULTS: The EFA yielded a 4-factor unidimensional model that explained between 62\% and 68\% of the total variance depending on the extraction method used. The estimated Cronbach's alpha for the PHPVS was .96. CONCLUSIONS: The PHPVS is a reliable measure of HPV knowledge, attitudes, and intent to vaccinate.},

year = {2013},
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We conducted a descriptive study of the correlates of refusal and acceptance of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination by rural parents of preadolescent and adolescent children. We hypothesized that the correlates of parents who allow their children aged 9 to 13 years to get the HPV vaccine and those of parents who do not allow vaccination would differ significantly. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was implemented during the school years 2009-2011 in the elementary and middle schools of three rural counties in Georgia. Parents were recruited at school functions to complete an anonymous validated survey. RESULTS: Parents who chose to vaccinate their children or intended to vaccinate were twice as likely to be from a race other than African American and 2.7 times more likely to have a religion other than Baptist. Using stepwise logistic regression and after adjustment for race and religion, we found that parents who had vaccinated or intended to vaccinate had significantly higher scores on perceived barriers (1.02 times more likely to vaccinate) and lower scores on perceived benefits (1.01 times more likely to vaccinate) (model p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that healthcare providers in rural areas can increase HPV vaccine uptake and reduce HPV-related cancers by using a multifaceted approach to educating their patients within the context of the patients' cultural values, geographic location, and economic situation. Such an approach could dispel misinformation and increase vaccine uptake.},

abstract = {Few resilience enhancement interventions are available to help homeless youth at high risk for mental health problems and substance abuse. Mindfulness meditation has demonstrated effectiveness in persons who deal with some of these issues. Our purpose was to examine the feasibility of delivering a spirituality development class-a minimally modified version of Yale University's 8-session Spiritual Self-Schema (3-S) program-to homeless youth in a shelter in an urban center in the Southeastern United States. We used a quasi-experimental, one group, pre- and post-intervention design with standardized self-report measures of impulsiveness, resilience, spirituality, mental wellness, and psychological symptoms. Seventy-one youth enrolled in the study; 39 of the youth attended at least four sessions of the class and completed the posttest. The spirituality development class was well received by the youth and, overall, participants demonstrated improvement on measures of spirituality, mental wellness, psychological symptoms, and resilience on the posttest. There were no statistically meaningful changes in impulsiveness scores. We concluded that mindfulness meditation programs are feasible for this population. Future studies of high-risk youth should use a randomized controlled trial design to examine the long-term impact of such training on psychological status and behavioral outcomes such as educational path, work attainment, and drug and alcohol abuse. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To identify predictors of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among rural African American families. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study in schools in three rural counties in southeastern United States. The sample consisted of African American parents or caregivers with children 9 to 13 years of age who attended elementary or middle school in 2010-2011. METHODS: Using an anonymous, 26-item survey, we collected descriptive data during parent-teacher events from African American parents with children in elementary or middle school. The main outcome was measured as a response of "yes" to the statement "I have or will vaccinate my child with the HPV vaccine." In addition, composite scores of knowledge and positive attitudes and beliefs were compared. No interventions were conducted. FINDINGS: We identified predictors of HPV vaccination and found that religious affiliation had a correlation with vaccinating or planning to vaccinate a child. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate a need for further research on the role of local culture, including religion and faith, in rural African Americans' decisions about giving their children the HPV vaccination. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study emphasizes the importance of understanding rural African American parents' knowledge, attitudes, and spiritual beliefs when designing health education programs and public health interventions to increase HPV vaccination uptake among African American boys and girls living in rural areas.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To explore the need for self-monitoring and self-care education in heart failure patients with diabetes (HF- DM patients) by describing cognitive and affective factors to provide guidance in developing effective self-management education. METHODS: A cross-sectional correlation design was employed using baseline patient data from a study testing a 12-week patient and family dyad intervention to improve dietary and medication-taking self-management behaviors in HF patients. Data from 116 participants recruited from metropolitan Atlanta area were used. Demographic and comorbidities, physical function, psychological distress, relationship with health care provider, self-efficacy (medication taking and low sodium diet), and behavioral outcomes (medications, dietary habits) were assessed. Descriptive statistics and a series of chi-square tests, t tests, or Mann-Whitney tests were performed to compare HF patients with and without DM. RESULTS: HF-DM patients were older and heavier, had more comorbidities, and took more daily medications than HF patients. High self-efficacy on medication and low-sodium diet was reported in both groups with no significant difference. Although HF-DM patients took more daily medications than HF, both groups exhibited high HF medication-taking behaviors. The HF-DM patients consumed significantly lower total sugar than HF patients but clinically higher levels of sodium. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes educators need to be aware of potential conflicts of treatment regimens to manage 2 chronic diseases. Special and integrated diabetes self-management education programs that incorporate principles of HF self-management should be developed to improve self-management behavior in HF-DM patients.},

volume = {27},
year = {2012},
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent guidelines for exercise in patients with heart failure (HF) recommended aerobic and resistance exercise as being safe and effective; however, the clinical and functional significance of these combined training modalities has not been established. In this pilot study, combined aerobic and resistance training was hypothesized to improve physical function, muscle strength, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) compared with an attention control wait list (ACWL). METHODS: The 10-item Continuous Scale Physical Functional Performance Test (CS-PFP10), which simulates common household chores; muscle strength (handgrip and knee extension); and HRQOL (Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire) were evaluated at baseline (T1) and at 12 weeks (T2). The home-based moderate-intensity walking and resistance training program was performed 5 days a week. RESULTS: Twenty-four New York Heart Association class II to III HF patients (mean [SD] age, 60 [10] years; mean [SD] left ventricular ejection fraction, 25\% [9\%]) were randomized to a combined aerobic and resistance exercise program or to an ACWL group. Of the total group, 58\% were New York Heart Association class III HF patients, 50\% were white, and 50\% were female. The CS-PFP10 total scores were significantly increased in the exercise group, from 45 (18) to 56 (16). The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary score was significantly improved (P < .001) at T2 in the exercise intervention group compared with the ACWL group. CONCLUSIONS: Participants provided the home-based, combined aerobic and resistance exercise program had significantly improved physical function, muscle strength, symptom severity, and HRQOL compared with the ACWL group. The findings of this study must be interpreted cautiously owing to the limitations of a small sample, data collection from a single center, and differences between control and interventions groups at baseline. A combined aerobic and resistance exercise approach may improve physical function in stable HF patients, but further study in a larger, more diverse population is recommended. However, in this study, the CS-PFP10 instrument demonstrated its ability to identify functional health status in HF patients and thus warrants further testing in a larger sample for possible use in clinical practice.},

volume = {37},
year = {2012},
abstract = {Social subordination in female macaques is imposed by harassment and the threat of aggression and produces reduced control over one's social and physical environment and a dysregulation of the limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis resembling that observed in people suffering from psychopathologies. These effects support the contention that this particular animal model is an ethologically relevant paradigm in which to investigate the etiology of stress-induced psychological illness related to women. Here, we sought to expand this model by performing a discriminate analysis (DA) on 33 variables within three domains; behavioral, metabolic/anthropomorphic, and neuroendocrine, collected from socially housed female rhesus monkeys in order to assess whether exposure to social subordination produces a distinct phenotype. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was also calculated to determine each domain's classification accuracy. DA found significant markers within each domain that differentiated dominant and subordinate females. Subordinate females received more aggression, showed more submissive behavior, and received less of affiliation from others than did dominant females. Metabolic differences included increased leptin, and reduced adiponectin in dominant compared to subordinate females. Dominant females exhibited increased sensitivity to hormonal stimulation with higher serum LH in response to estradiol, cortisol in response to ACTH, and increased glucocorticoid negative feedback. Serum oxytocin, CSF DOPAC and serum PACAP were all significantly higher in dominant females. ROC curve analysis accurately predicted social status in all three domains. Results suggest that socially house rhesus monkeys represent a cogent animal model in which to study the physiology and behavioral consequences of chronic psychosocial stress in humans.},

The purposes of this study were: (1) to describe the effect of a psychoeducational intervention on sleep quality and daytime sleepiness, (2) to describe patterns of sleep over time, and (3) to identify predictors of poor sleep in an ICD population. METHODS: A randomized longitudinal intervention trial was designed to test the effects of a psychoeducational intervention, which included a sleep education and counseling session in patients receiving their initial ICD. Patients (n=236; 75\% men; mean age 58.4 [±11.2] from the PsychoEducationAl Intervention for ICD PatiEnts (PEACE) trial comprised the study population. Variables related to sleep were measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). RESULTS: No psychoeducational intervention effects on sleep outcomes were observed. However, 67.2\% of the patients reported poor sleep quality at baseline, and 56.8\% had low sleep quality at 6 months based on PSQI scores>5; one-third (32.6\%) were excessively sleepy based on ESS scores≥10 at 6 months. Anxiety, depression, physical function, pain intensity, and pain severity were all highly correlated to each other across time. Female gender was a significant covariate for the PSQI. New York Heart Association (NYHA) class was a significant covariate for sleepiness (Epworth). CONCLUSIONS: Low sleep quality and daytime sleepiness are found at time of insertion and over time in patients with ICD. Female gender, higher NYHA class, as well as two latent factors encompassing increased anxiety, depressive symptoms, and decreased physical function and increased pain, were significant predictors of poor sleep quality and sleepiness over time. These data help identify those at higher risk for sleep problems after ICD.},

The purpose of this pilot study was to assess the efficacy of a group intervention using motivational interviewing (MI) to promote adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and use of risk reduction behaviors (RRB) among HIV-infected women in Nigeria. Recruited participants (n=60) were randomly assigned to the motivational group or the health promotion program (HPP) control group. The 6 month follow-up results indicate that, compared to the control group, MI participants reported significantly higher levels of adherence to ART, higher knowledge of HIV, higher use of condoms/protection during sexual encounters and decision-making not to have sex when no protection was available. The MI participants also had fewer mean number of sexual partners. MI in group format shows promise in promoting adherence to ART and use of RRB in HIV-infected Nigerian women.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the U.S., Europe, and throughout the world, abdominal obesity prevalence is increasing. Depressive symptoms may contribute to abdominal obesity through the consumption of diets high in energy density. PURPOSE: To test dietary energy density ([DED]; kilocalories/gram of food and beverages consumed) for an independent relationship with abdominal obesity or as a mediator between depressive symptoms and abdominal obesity. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 87 mid-life, overweight adults; 73.6\% women; 50.6\% African-American. Variables and measures: Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II) to measure depressive symptoms; 3-day weighed food records to calculate DED; and waist circumference, an indicator of abdominal obesity. Hierarchical regression tested if DED explained waist circumference variance while controlling for depressive symptoms and consumed food and beverage weight. Three approaches tested DED as a mediator. RESULTS: Nearly three-quarters of participants had abdominal obesity, and the mean waist circumference was 103.2 (SD 14.3) cm. Mean values: BDI-II was 8.67 (SD 8.34) which indicates that most participants experienced minimal depressive symptoms, and 21.8\% reported mild to severe depressive symptoms (BDI-II ≥ 14); DED was 0.75 (SD 0.22) kilocalories/gram. Hierarchical regression showed an independent association between DED and waist circumference with DED explaining 7.0\% of variance above that accounted for by BDI-II and food and beverage weight. DED did not mediate between depressive symptoms and abdominal obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms and DED were associated with elevated waist circumference, thus a comprehensive intervention aimed at improving depressive symptoms and decreasing DED to reduce waist circumference is warranted.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of a home-based aerobic and resistance training program on the physical function of adults with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II and III patients and systolic heart failure (HF). DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Home based. PARTICIPANTS: Stable patients (N=24; mean age, 60 ± 10 y; left ventricular ejection fraction, 25\% ± 9\%; 50\% white; 50\% women) with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II and III (NYHA class III, 58\%) systolic heart failure (HF). INTERVENTION: A 12-week progressive home-based program of moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance exercise. Attention control wait list participants performed light stretching and flexibility exercises. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A 10-item performance-based physical function measure, the Continuous Scale Physical Functional Performance test (CS-PFP10), was the major outcome variable and included specific physical activities measured in time to complete a task, weight carried during a task, and distance walked. Other measures included muscle strength, HRQOL (Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale), functional capacity (Duke Activity Status Index), and disease severity (brain natriuretic peptide) levels. RESULTS: After the exercise intervention, 9 of 10 specific task activities were performed more rapidly, with increased weight carried by exercise participants compared with the attention control wait list group. Exercise participants also showed significant improvements in CS-PFP10 total score (P<.025), upper and lower muscle strength, and HRQOL (P<.001) compared with the attention control wait list group. Adherence rates were 83\% and 99\% for the aerobic and resistance training, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stable HF who participate in a moderate-intensity combined aerobic and resistance exercise program may improve performance of routine physical activities of daily living by using a home-based exercise approach. Performance-based measures such as the CS-PFP10 may provide additional insights into physical function in patients with HF that more commonly used exercise tests may not identify. Early detection of subtle changes that may signal declining physical function that are amenable to intervention potentially may slow further loss of function in this patient population.},

STUDY SETTING: This study analyzed deidentified nursing data from the Kenya Health Workforce Informatics System, collected by the Nursing Council of Kenya and the Department of Nursing in the Ministry of Medical Services. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed trends in Kenya's nursing workforce from 1999 to 2007, including supply, deployment, and intent to out-migrate, measured by requests for verification of credentials from destination countries. PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: From 1999 to 2007, 6 percent of Kenya's nursing workforce of 41,367 nurses applied to out-migrate. Eighty-five percent of applicants were registered or B.Sc.N. prepared nurses, 49 percent applied within 10 years of their initial registration as a nurse, and 82 percent of first-time applications were for the United States or United Kingdom. For every 4.5 nurses that Kenya adds to its nursing workforce through training, 1 nurse from the workforce applies to out-migrate, potentially reducing by 22 percent Kenya's ability to increase its nursing workforce through training. CONCLUSIONS: Nurse out-migration depletes Kenya's nursing workforce of its most highly educated nurses, reduces the percentage of younger nurses in an aging nursing stock, decreases Kenya's ability to increase its nursing workforce through training, and represents a substantial economic loss to the country.},

We hypothesized that participation in a team training program using the modified TeamSTEPPS program would positively affect knowledge and attitudes toward teamwork skills and their ability to recognize the presence and quality of team skills. METHODS: Two hundred thirteen students participated in a 4-hour team training program that included a lecture followed by small group team training exercises. Nurse/physician pairs facilitated student team activities. Knowledge and attitudes were assessed before and after the educational intervention. Recognition of team skills was assessed using videos. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found with participant knowledge (P<0.001) and attitude (P=0.004). Students were able to identify the presence and quality of team skills in the video vignettes. Overwhelmingly, the students recognized team skills much better in the success video than in the opportunity video (P<0.001), and they rated the success video much higher than the opportunity video (P<0.001) with regards to the quality of team skills. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully adapted TeamSTEPPS for use with our medical and nursing students, educated facilitators, and implemented the course. Our students improved their knowledge of vital team and communication skills, attitudes toward working as teams, and were able to identify effective team skills.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE: Abdominal obesity, the central distribution of adipose tissue, is a well-established cardiometabolic disease risk factor. The prevalence has steadily increased since 1988, and now more than 50\% of adults have abdominal obesity. Psychological distress coupled with increased dietary energy density (ED) may contribute to abdominal obesity. Guided by the stress and coping model, this study examined the relationship between psychological factors (perceived stress and depressive symptoms) and dietary ED in overweight, working adults. The first hypothesis tested if psychological factors explained a significant amount of food and beverage ED variance above that accounted for by demographic factors. The second hypothesis tested if psychological factors explained a significant amount of food and nonalcoholic beverage ED variance above that accounted for by demographic factors. Post hoc analyses compared macronutrient composition and food group pattern between overweight, working adults with and without depressive symptoms. METHODS: This descriptive, cross-sectional, correlation study was composed of 87 overweight, working adults (mean age, 41.3 [SD, 10.2] years; mean body mass index, 32.1 [SD, 6.1] kg/m²; 73.6\% women; 50.6\% African American). Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory II and Perceived Stress Scale and weighed-3-day-food record analyzed for caloric intake (kilocalories) and weight (in grams) of consumed foods and beverages that were used to calculate ED (in kilocalories/gram). Height and weight were measured to calculate body mass index. Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, and sequential regression modeling were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms were reported by 21.9\% of participants and explained variance in food and beverage ED above that accounted for by African American race and reporting adequate caloric intake. Depressive symptoms explained variance in food and nonalcoholic beverage ED above that accounted for male sex, African American race, and reporting adequate caloric intake. Perceived stress and depressive symptoms were positively correlated; however, perceived stress was not a significant predictor of food and beverage ED. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms, potentially modifiable, were 4 times that found in the general population and independently predicted increased food and beverage ED. Further research is needed to determine if improvements in depressive symptoms alter dietary ED, potentially reducing cardiometabolic disease risk.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a combined 12-week home-based exercise (EX)/cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program (n=18) with CBT alone (n=19), EX alone (n=20), and with usual care (UC, n=17) in stable New York Heart Association Class II to III heart failure (HF) patients diagnosed with depression. METHODS: Depressive symptom severity [Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D)], physical function [6-min walk test (6MWT)], and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire) were evaluated at baseline (T1), after the 12-week intervention/control (T2), and following a 3-month telephone follow-up (T3). A repeated measures analysis of variance was used to determine group differences. Depression severity was dichotomized as minor (HAM-D, 11-14) and moderate-to-major depression (HAM-D, >/=15), and group intervention and control responses were also evaluated on that basis. RESULTS: The greatest reduction in HAM-D scores over time occurred in the EX/CBT group (-10.4) followed by CBT (-9.6), EX (-7.3), and UC (-6.2), but none were statistically significant. The combined group showed a significant increase in 6-min walk distance at 24 weeks (F=13.5, P<.001). Among all groups with moderate-to-major depression, only those in CBT/EX had sustained lower HAM-D scores at 12 and 24 weeks, 6MWT distances were significantly greater at 12 (P=.018) and 24 (P=.013) weeks, and the greatest improvement in HRQOL also occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions designed to improve both physical and psychological symptoms may provide the best method for optimizing functioning and enhancing HRQOL in patients with HF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: : Caregivers (CGs) of heart failure (HF) patients are increasingly assuming greater responsibilities in symptom assessment, evaluation, and decision making and may be asked to serve as proxies. The purpose of this study was to examine the degree of congruence between HF patients and their primary CG on symptom assessment and self-care management behaviors. METHODS: : The sample consisted of 70 HF patients receiving home healthcare and their designated CG. Patients were primarily between 40 and 85 years of age and female (60\%). Caregivers were predominately female (76\%) and spouses (43\%). Congruence in symptom assessment and management between HF patients and their designated CGs was measured in this descriptive cross-sectional study using the Heart Failure Symptom Survey and Self-care of Heart Failure Index. RESULTS: : The Spearman correlation coefficient and concordance correlation coefficient were used to assess the degree of congruence on symptom evaluation scores from the Heart Failure Symptom Survey. Dyads had the strongest correlations on ratings of the HF patients' symptoms of extremity edema, difficulty concentrating, and dizziness. Lower congruence (Spearman correlation <0.40) was found on feeling depressed, shortness of breath at night, and shortness of breath when lying down. Scores on the Self-care of Heart Failure Index self-care management and self-care confidence scales were not significantly different within the HF dyads. CONCLUSIONS: : Based on moderate levels of correlations on most HF symptoms in this study, the CG as proxy appears to be a reasonable substitute for patient responses in a community setting. However, greater family preparation for symptom assessment is warranted to improve congruence for future symptom assessment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the clinical attributes of severe asthma in children have been well described, the differentiating features of the lower airway inflammatory response are less understood. OBJECTIVES: We sought to discriminate severe from moderate asthma in children by applying linear discriminant analysis, a supervised method of high-dimensional data reduction, to cytokines and chemokines measured in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and alveolar macrophage (AM) lysate. METHODS: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was available from 53 children with asthma (severe asthma, n = 31) undergoing bronchoscopy for clinical indications and 30 nonsmoking adults. Twenty-three cytokines and chemokines were measured by using bead-based multiplex assays. Linear discriminant analyses of the BAL fluid and AM analytes were performed to develop predictive models of severe asthma in children. RESULTS: Although univariate analysis of single analytes did not differentiate severe from moderate asthma in children, linear discriminant analyses allowed for near complete separation of the moderate and severe asthmatic groups. Significant correlations were also noted between several of the AM and BAL analytes measured. In the BAL fluid, IL-13 and IL-6 differentiated subjects with asthma from controls, whereas growth-related oncogene (CXCL1), RANTES (CCL5), IL-12, IFN-gamma, and IL-10 best characterized severe versus moderate asthma in children. In the AM lysate, IL-6 was the strongest discriminator of all the groups. CONCLUSION: Severe asthma in children is characterized by a distinct airway molecular phenotype that does not have a clear T(H)1 or T(H)2 pattern. Improved classification of children with severe asthma may assist with the development of targeted therapeutics for this group of children who are difficult to treat.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVE: Several heart failure (HF) knowledge tools have been developed and tested over the past decade; however, they vary in content, format, psychometric properties, and availability. This article details the development, psychometric testing, and revision of the Atlanta Heart Failure Knowledge Test (A-HFKT) as a standardized instrument for both the research and clinical settings. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Development and psychometric testing of the A-HFKT were undertaken with 116 New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II and III community-dwelling HF patients and their family members (FMs) participating in a family intervention study. Internal consistency, reliability, and content validity were examined. Construct validity was assessed by correlating education level, literacy, dietary sodium ingestion, medication adherence, and healthcare utilization with knowledge. RESULTS: Content validity ratings on relevance and clarity ranged from 0.55 to 1.0, with 81\% of the items rated from 0.88 to 1.0. Cronbach alpha values were .84 for patients, .75 for FMs, and .73 for combined results. Construct validity testing revealed a small but significant correlation between higher patient and FM knowledge on sodium restriction questions and lower ingested sodium, r = -0.17, P = .05 and r = -0.19, P = .04, respectively, and between patient knowledge and number of days that medications were taken correctly (diuretics: r = 0.173, P < .05, and angiotensin-converting enzyme: r = 0.223, P = .01). Finally, patients seeking emergency care or requiring hospitalization in the 4 months before study entry were found to have significantly lower FM knowledge using both t test and logistic regression modeling. CONCLUSIONS: The A-HFKT was revised using the content and construct validity data and is available for use with HF patients and FMs. The construct validity testing indicates that patient knowledge has a significant relationship to aspects of self-care. Furthermore, family knowledge may influence patient adherence with sodium restriction and healthcare utilization behavior.},

abstract = {Detection of illegal Cannabis cultivation by law enforcement agencies currently relies on low flying aircraft manned by trained aerial spotters. This is physically tiring for the aircrew, inefficient for large or complex landscapes, and is often foiled by camouflaged grow sites. A solution for detecting illegal Cannabis cultivation using remote sensing would be of considerable assistance and may increase the probability of detection. If multiple plants are grown in large homogeneous plots and the location of at least one cultivation site is known, then detection can be considered a traditional spectral land cover/land use classification problem. Probability of success is principally dependent upon the degree to which the known grow site is representative of unknown sites, and the adequacy of the sensor system spatial resolution. However, most illegal cultivation sites in the U.S. are "distributed" with a few isolated plants interspersed with other plant species. For distributed cultivations, requirements for high spatial resolution imagery become paramount and an alternative signature approach may be warranted. Analysis of Cannabis diffuse, nadir spectral signatures using laboratory, field and airborne data show a lack of stable, unique absorption features to use as a universal reference signature. However, Cannabis leaves appear to have a specular reflectance feature that contributes to the "emerald green" appearance reported by aerial spotters. This specular signature may be worthy of exploitation for detection. The leaf shape and plant architecture of Cannabis also offer potential spatial signatures that can be quantified using image texture analysis. These spatial signatures also warrant further investigation.},

abstract = {Although the potential benefits of infrared imaging systems in law enforcement applications have been apparent for many years, budget and technology constraints have prevented their widespread deployment. Recent technology improvements and cost reductions, however, have made the routine use of handheld thermal imagers practical for the law enforcement community. This effort involved both an analysis of operational and technical requirements associated with law enforcement use as well as a comprehensive review of commercially available handheld infrared imaging systems. The use of handheld infrared systems in the counterdrug environment is also addressed, including the results of an analysis of proven applications, a review of training requirements, and a summary of legal issues associated with infrared surveillance. Results generated by the NVTHERM infrared sensor model are also shown for one handheld imager to provide representative information regarding low-cost thermal imager performance.},

abstract = {Isomeric aldohexose sugars derivatized using the alditol acetate method produce diastereomeric products that can be differentiated by electron impact (EI)-mass spectrometry. The use of sodium borodeuteride for reduction in the derivatization scheme enables identification of aldohexoses because their hexitol hexaacetate products retain the chirality of the starting sugar. The observed differences in the EI-mass spectra were visualized using principal component analysis and cluster analysis. The statistical significance of these differences was evaluated using Hotelling's T2 statistic for the comparison of multivariate cluster means. The electron impact mass spectra of nondeuterated and deuterated hexitol hexaacetates permit differentiation of the diastereomeric nondeuterated hexitol hexaacetates as well as identification of all of the aldohexoses. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

abstract = {Fourier transform (FT)-Raman spectroscopy was used to monitor the curing reaction of a polyimide bonding agent, the Ciba-Geigy Matrimid® system. Major Raman bands were assigned by comparison to spectra for small model molecules, by use of ab initio calculations, and by reference to previous literature. The set of FT-Raman spectra taken at various intervals during the curing process was modeled by principal component analysis (PCA). Cure percentage determined by differential scanning calorimetry was then regressed against scores on the first principal component for the different polymer samples. The PCA and regression results summarized significant trends in the FT-Raman spectra and led to a better understanding of the curing mechanism. © 1994.},
